19:09:16 From Daniel Bautista To Everyone:
	üëç
19:09:50 From Jeremy Boccabello To Everyone:
	Although 5% can be your baseline if you are doing family wise correction on the whole set of hypothesis tests for instance
19:10:35 From Daniel Bautista To Everyone:
	Better to tie the 5% to a more tangible consequence then
19:10:38 From Taylor Olson To All Panelists:
	Are PCA and tSNE for numerical variables only? Can you do if categorical?
19:10:46 From Moderator - [Ankit Agrawal] To Everyone:
	Q: Does it typically mean that 5% is not low enough?	A: It depends on the application. 5% is considered a standard if a significance level isn't specified

19:12:55 From Gloria Olar To All Panelists:
	Q: for PCA, can we find out what the different PCs represent? Like which variable(s) defines PC1 and PC2?
19:12:55 From Johnson Oguntuase To Everyone:
	Does the t-SNE provide any insight into PCs of the dataset?
19:13:08 From Moderator - [Ankit Agrawal] To Everyone:
	Q: What is the best way to interpret the t-SNE plot?	A: It tries to preserve the global representation of data in lower dimensions. It is not focused on preserving the variance like PCA does
19:13:09 From Daniel Bautista To Everyone:
	Don't want to derail the lecture but for the faculty: are there techniques for mapping to higher dimensional rather than lower dimensional spaces too and when are they used?
19:14:18 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	The axis is selected based on which "direction" provides the most useful information
19:14:51 From Moderator - [Ankit Agrawal] To Everyone:
	Q: for PCA, can we find out what the different PCs represent? Like which variable(s) defines PC1 and PC2?	A: Yes, since each PC component represents a linear relationship between the features, we can look at the coefficients of them for each component
19:15:02 From Fausto Correa To All Panelists:
	When should we use PCA or t-SNE? Is there any parameter that lead us

	so its a 2 dimensional matrix?
19:48:10 From Shilpa Murthy To Everyone:
	Is the dot product also a symmetric matrix?
19:48:18 From simona tenaglia To Everyone:
	dop products give us common freinds between subjet 1 and 2?
19:48:20 From Swati Chandna To Everyone:
	I think common friends = sum of (product of common friends column)
19:48:24 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@shilpa it is a scaler
19:48:25 From Julio Rojas To Everyone:
	can this also be applied to spatial problems ?
19:48:25 From Raj Desikavinayagompillai To Everyone:
	Common friends=1st level connection vs second level connection vs 3rd level connection where the node is. This is visible in LinkedIn network
19:48:34 From ashish kumar To Everyone:
	when would an adjacency matrix have weights? and can you then do A^2?
19:48:41 From Shilpa Murthy To Everyone:
	Is the dot product also a symmetric matrix?
19:48:46 From Vikram Baghel To Everyone:
	So like O(n^2) complexity to find common friends .. for million/billion nodes.  ?
19:49:35 From Swati Chandna To Everyone:
	I would think for weighted network, instead of putting 1, we will put actual weights
19:49:35 From Julie Mann To Everyone:
	using log n?
19:49:41 From Raj Desikavinayagompillai To Everyone:
	Distance between nodes
19:49:45 From Filippo Caviglioni To Everyone:
	A^3
19:49:47 From Shilpa Murthy To Everyone:
	A^3
19:49:48 From Asad Khan To Everyone:
	no idea
19:49:54 From Roman Neuhauser To Everyone:
	counting the nodes
19:50:07 From drashti darji To Everyone:
	By directed graph
19:50:18 From Swati Chandna To Everyone:
	Can you give an example of A to thepower 3
19:50:20 From Moderator - [Ankit Agrawal] To Everyone:
	Q: Is the dot product also a symmetric matrix?	A: If you multiply 2 square matrices, the result is also a square matrix. It may not be symmetric.
19:50:22 From Bernardo Serafin To Everyone:
	Permutation
19:50:25 From Javier Eduardo Marquez Orjuela To Everyone:
	Giving Weight to de Edge?
19:50:25 From Sidrat Tasawoor Kanth To Everyone:
	that‚Äôs neat.
19:50:25 From Andrew Carlson To Everyone:
	Q: This seems helpful if you assume "significance of connection" is treated as equal. In this example, how do you capture the "strength" of the connection.
19:50:25 From Julie Mann To Everyone:
	does A^ 3 have to be a square matrix to apply?
19:50:47 From Alisher Jardemaliyev To Everyone:
	how will A3 look like?
19:50:50 From Alisher Jardemaliyev To Everyone:
	visually
19:50:54 From Alisher Jardemaliyev To Everyone:
	could you show pls?
19:51:06 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	@Julie - they are all square for this by necessity.
19:51:27 From Neha Purohit To Everyone:
	What does A**3 present?
19:51:33 From Julie Mann To Everyone:
	@shelrandall üôÇ thanks
19:51:46 From Santiago Arroyo To Everyone:
	But if it is weight it would not give the number of paths
19:51:56 From Anil Goud To All Panelists:
	That is a little confusing can you write an examples with A^3 or A^4?
19:52:00 From Santiago Arroyo To Everyone:
	right?
19:52:03 From Swati Chandna To Everyone:
	How do you represent multigraph Network?
19:52:09 From simona tenaglia To Everyone:
	could you repeat what A^3 means?
19:52:17 From Moderator - [Ankit Agrawal] To Everyone:
	Q: dop products give us common freinds between subjet 1 and 2?	A: Dot product gives a single value representation between 2 vectors which can be treated as strength of relationship between them
19:52:44 From Deepak Monga To Everyone:
	what is the concept of A to the power3 and 4?
19:53:05 From Soumyo Banerjee To Everyone:
	How would we do this based on the number of common attributes (such as location, common interest, etc.) ?
19:53:09 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Deepak, how many nodes have 3 or 4 edges between them.
19:53:25 From Deepak Monga To Everyone:
	Thanks
19:53:29 From Sidrat Tasawoor Kanth To Everyone:
	size? how sparse? symmetric?
19:53:50 From Anil Goud To All Panelists:
	Of course‚Ä¶me too...lol
19:54:00 From Moderator - [Ankit Agrawal] To Everyone:
	Q: So like O(n^2) complexity to find common friends .. for million/billion nodes. ?	A: For large matrices (social media), these matrices are extremely sparse so different methods are used to compute A^2, A^3. Mathematical optimizations like SVD allow such computations much faster.
19:54:16 From Swati Chandna To Everyone:
	Is this typically a Data Engineer or Data Analyst's job in the real world?
19:54:22 From Neha Purohit To Everyone:
	When you con reach from each node in the components
19:54:27 From Vikram Baghel To Everyone:
	Ty @Ankit.. thought so
19:55:02 From Hend Alqaderi To All Panelists:
	What is the minimum sample size to conduct connected component
19:55:17 From Paula Valverde To All Panelists:
	As a quantitative measure, Could you measure the ‚Äúperformance‚Äù of these networks?
19:55:44 From Anil Goud To Everyone:
	Can the connected component groups be connected as multi-node nodes via something like an API from Facebook to Instagram?
19:55:52 From Shilpa Murthy To Everyone:
	@deepak more precisely how many nodes are 3 (unit edges)/4 units away from each other/ not fully how many edges
19:56:45 From Aman Singhai To Everyone:
	Q) Single nodes are not connected (no self loop), why are we calling them connected components?
19:56:48 From Shel Randall To Everyone:

19:58:03 From Anil Goud To Everyone:
	Kim kardashian
19:58:10 From Mamta B To Everyone:

	LOL
19:58:45 From Javier Eduardo Marquez Orjuela To Everyone:
	Aka influencer?
19:58:57 From Eric White To Everyone:
	So 1 person could be in more than one component size?
19:59:16 From Jeremy Boccabello To Everyone:
	so are connected components other than the largest not connected to the largest?
19:59:16 From Sophia Arellano To Everyone:
	Number of components means number of Friends?
19:59:24 From ashish kumar To Everyone:
	would you consider outliers in this chart?
19:59:37 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	"followers" not friends
19:59:39 From Julie Mann To Everyone:
	Therefore, Facebook is now baby boomers, lacks growth and tik tok is king?
19:59:40 From Moderator - [Ankit Agrawal] To Everyone:
	Q) Single nodes are not connected (no self loop), why are we calling them connected components?	A: Think about set theory and being able to perform unions and intersections. It's easier if we find a way to represent all of the data in same way i.e. connected components of size >= 1
19:59:52 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	"stalkers" not "followers"
20:00:08 From Mayda Alkhaldi To Everyone:
	So is the connected component considered a user let‚Äôs on a social media platform or?
20:00:14 From Sean Kurian To Everyone:
	Bots not stalkers
20:00:24 From Awad Alomari, PE To Everyone:
	is this the Gea component?
20:00:34 From Eric White To Everyone:
	Oh so you would only work with that one dot out to the right?
20:00:38 From Kamaraju, Supriya To All Panelists:

20:00:57 From Julie Mann To Everyone:
	@shel i'll join your bot team
20:01:04 From Raj Desikavinayagompillai To Everyone:
	What is that 1% which is not connected. Is it the people in certain countries are not connected with the rest of the world?
20:01:06 From Soumyo Banerjee To Everyone:
	For a ad/marketer - should it focus all effort on the 1 large ccmmponent ?
20:01:10 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Sophia
20:01:18 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	the 1e8 has 99.1
20:01:22 From Moderator - [Ankit Agrawal] To Everyone:
	Q: As a quantitative measure, Could you measure the ‚Äúperformance‚Äù of these networks?	A: Yes. High # of connected components of greater sizes is usually a good thing.
20:01:23 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	.9 remains
20:01:56 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	The dots are not accounts, they are nets, the one on the right is a network, those on the left, disconnected nets
20:02:16 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	ah so the .09% are 'islands' of people unconnected to the rest of the network
20:02:25 From Sophia Arellano To Everyone:
	oh ok so talking about the remain, sorry I was just Reading the scale as it was
20:02:40 From Anil Goud To Everyone:
	Or islands of networks like a closed group of amish people that don‚Äôt want anyone to know they are using the internet
20:02:44 From Moderator - [Ankit Agrawal] To Everyone:
	Q: could some of those of size-1 or 2 be fake /dummy accounts to spread misinformation?	A: That is an over simplification. Most accounts with small sizes don't get the high visibility to their content but the goal of spreading misinformation is to reach high number of people.
20:02:50 From Andrew Carlson To Everyone:
	Does this help support "six degrees of separation" theory?
20:03:32 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@andrew, I think so.  The 0.9% are not within the 6 degrees of the 99.1% though
20:03:58 From Sean Kurian To All Panelists:
	Log to base 10? Or base 2?
20:04:09 From Andrew Carlson To Everyone:
	@Daniel, Very interesting! Neat to see the data behind the theory.
20:04:15 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	it states 99.91% of people are 'n' degrees of separation from others in the 99.91%.  But nothing about the degree 'average'
20:05:01 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@joshua, previous slide had that as ‚Äúk‚Äù (left panel)
20:05:06 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	I think
20:05:19 From Mayda Alkhaldi To Everyone:
	What do we mean by degree on these graphs? What does that represent or tell us?
20:05:46 From Shilpa Murthy To Everyone:
	Degree = number of edges (how connected the node is)
20:05:48 From Sophia Arellano To Everyone:
	What fraction means?
20:05:53 From Swati Chandna To Everyone:
	degree  of node - number of edges connected
20:06:03 From TP Singh To Everyone:
	Does log always imply log 10 scale?
20:06:13 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	up to 100 = sincere, but > 1000 = poser
20:06:37 From Julie Mann To Everyone:

20:08:14 From Bernardo Serafin To Everyone:
	@Julie Mann I'd think so
20:08:14 From Shel Randall To Everyone:

20:08:24 From Vikram Baghel To Everyone:
	Not new page I think.. but those famous guys can be ‚Äòfollowed‚Äô. Instead of ‚Äòfriended‚Äô
20:08:39 From Sumeet Deshpande To Everyone:
	Is the 5000 limit applied to Connections which is different from Following on social networks where celebrities have millions of followers?
20:08:39 From Vikram Baghel To Everyone:
	Yes
20:08:41 From Andrew Carlson To Everyone:
	for 5000 friends, if you added 1 friend a day, it would take over 13 yeasr!
20:08:53 From Alisher Jardemaliyev To Everyone:
	so most people have 50 less than 50 friends?
20:08:55 From Anil Goud To Everyone:
	Does this type of behavior happen in person? Can we only handle a certain number of real relationships before we start dropping people?
20:08:57 From Lalit Vyas To Everyone:
	hmmm.. so this graph captures the removal and addition of friends ?
20:08:59 From Mamta B To Everyone:
	Buy instagram instead to manage those 5K+ relationships üôÇ
20:09:22 From Alisher Jardemaliyev To Everyone:

20:10:00 From Fausto Correa To All Panelists:
	Same question here about fraction
20:10:05 From Aman Singhai To Everyone:
	so for more than 5000 friends, it has to become directed connection (with followers) instead of undirected connection üòÑ
20:10:21 From Julie Mann To Everyone:

20:14:34 From Shilpa Murthy To Everyone:
	Is the time complexity of finding the diameter around O(n^3) or O(n^2elog(n)) or is there a better computational method for it?
20:14:46 From Moderator - [Ankit Agrawal] To Everyone:
	Q: how useful is the diameter?	A: Very. It can give you the "width of the graph" i.e. largest smallest distance between 2 nodes.	Think about running marketing campaigns or emergency services and trying to figure out reachability.
20:14:57 From Sidrat Tasawoor Kanth To Everyone:
	so we want the longest shortest path?
20:15:07 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	yep
20:15:11 From Anil Goud To Everyone:
	That makes sese
20:15:14 From Roman Neuhauser To Everyone:
	so its the shortest numbers of steps
20:15:22 From Vidhya Shankarraman To Everyone:
	so diameter is not longest but longest shortest?
20:15:30 From Varuni Rao To Everyone:
	how do you find the fartest points in the graph?
20:15:30 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	its the longest shortest

	Is this how you compute a route in a Navigation System?
20:17:53 From Moderator - [Ankit Agrawal] To Everyone:
	Q: how do you find the fartest points in the graph?	A: You can compute Dijkstra's algorithm for all pairs of nodes and then take the maximum (logically speaking).
20:17:58 From Anil Goud To Everyone:

20:22:13 From Luca Mastrantoni To Everyone:
	they could have not taken the shortest path
20:22:15 From Swati Chandna To Everyone:
	If the steps are 5.9, shouldn't the diameter be smaller than that
20:22:15 From Andrew Carlson To Everyone:
	Might not be the shortest path
20:22:19 From Taylor Olson To Everyone:
	People didn‚Äôt know how they were connected
20:22:26 From Shilpa Murthy To Everyone:
	The degree of freedom of the 1 person can be small
20:22:39 From EUNICE HERNANDEZ To Everyone:
	Does the size of the population in this case affect the number of steps? And how does it affect? Would it take longest?
20:22:42 From Raj Desikavinayagompillai To Everyone:
	The path for node is not visible for the sender
20:22:56 From Bernardo Serafin To Everyone:
	Wow!
20:23:37 From ashish kumar To Everyone:
	LinkedIn shows the user the diameter of the network, right?
20:23:46 From Javier Eduardo Marquez Orjuela To Everyone:
	Does Internet Protocol uses this path without giving importance if is the shortest path?
20:23:51 From Moderator - [Ankit Agrawal] To Everyone:
	Q: Does the size of the population in this case affect the number of steps? And how does it affect? Would it take longest?	A: Experimentation shows that we approach the value of 6 hops as the size of network grows.
20:23:52 From Barbara Timm-Brock To Everyone:
	Back in 1967 the post office delivered 2x/day, and had next day for many cities, so the letters probably got there. The rate of lost mail was very low. (Retired postal supervisor in the family!)
20:24:27 From Megha Sharma To Everyone:
	6 degree is 6 hops?
20:24:31 From Raj Desikavinayagompillai To Everyone:
	Internet protocol uses Border Gateway protocol how to route the traffic
20:24:32 From Anil Goud To Everyone:
	I assumed it was hand to hand letter deliverying
20:24:47 From Jeremy Boccabello To Everyone:
	So surveillance under FISA laws allows surveillance of hundreds of thousands of people for each FISA warrant because it allows 3 network hops
20:24:48 From Sophia Arellano To Everyone:
	So we can send a letter to Taylor Swift?
20:24:51 From Mamta B To Everyone:
	Why the US Vs Global is different - Connectivity is better for longer distance?
20:24:54 From Joe Aitken To Everyone:
	what is considered a hop?
20:24:57 From Swati Chandna To Everyone:
	wow!
20:24:57 From Julie Mann To Everyone:
	But diameter of 6 is shrinking to 3+ due to desire to connect through social media?
20:25:00 From Soumyo Banerjee To Everyone:
	Wonder how it looks for LinkedIn
20:25:08 From Vikram Baghel To Everyone:
	All you need is 5 more friends.. to each whoever 6th person of your dream is
20:25:09 From Andrew Carlson To Everyone:
	ü§ì
20:25:19 From Arturo √Åvalos To All Panelists:

20:25:32 From Kyle Ragaller To Everyone:
	i know the guitar tech on swifts tour, you are all 2 steps to taylor swift, lol
20:25:35 From Carlos Eduardo Jauregui Briceno To Everyone:
	wow! interesting approach to apply for any business "networks"
20:25:42 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	It just takes one international connection using this metric, right?
20:25:45 From Awad Alomari, PE To Everyone:
	is this just a coincidence !
20:25:47 From Bernardo Serafin To Everyone:
	@Mamta US diameter is actually smaller, just 5 hops to reach almost 100%
20:25:54 From Johnson Oguntuase To Everyone:
	Does it mean we have to go through 6 people to reach at least 1 million people on Facebook?
20:25:58 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	3 Kyle, you are 2
20:25:58 From Jose Rojas To Everyone:
	Is that considering companies accounts?
20:26:04 From Stephany Gochuico To Everyone:
	I live in France. If I want to reach the US President, then it would only take 6 hops ???
20:26:04 From Santiago Arroyo To Everyone:
	Given the hop distance 4, does it suggests US people are les well connected
20:26:05 From Sujasha Gupta To Everyone:
	very interesting phenomenon seen globally
20:26:08 From Luca Mastrantoni To Everyone:
	does the density of the network influence the number of hops?
20:26:09 From Julie Mann To Everyone:
	This group just shrunk the 6 degrees .....
20:26:15 From Lalit Vyas To Everyone:
	why is this important to know ?
20:26:20 From Omar Alsaid Sulaiman To Everyone:
	This is basically the Erd√∂s number
20:26:32 From Santiago Arroyo To Everyone:
	Or global has better connection given high populations in certain countries
20:26:32 From Shilpa Murthy To Everyone:
	Kyle! That‚Äôs true public service
20:26:43 From Gaetano Caolo To Everyone:
	what is hop distance?
20:26:43 From Anil Goud To Everyone:
	Would it stay the same if max friends grow to 10,000? Instead of 5,000
20:26:53 From Santiago Arroyo To Everyone:
	Or better connectivity?
20:26:55 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	So, six degrees between the Pope and Hitler?
20:27:02 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Omar, the limit of the Erdos number
20:27:03 From Jaime Romanini To Everyone:
	6 hops reachs to 15Billion people (theory)
20:27:04 From Sellathurai Sriganesha To Everyone:
	hard to believe. Does FB have fake accounts that connect people?
20:27:12 From Sashi Konda To Everyone:
	how many hops would it have taken for Covid to spread globally?
20:27:12 From Anil Goud To Everyone:
	Thank you
20:27:13 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	If defined, it is 6 or less.
20:27:15 From Ketan Kamdar To Everyone:

20:27:17 From Sophia Arellano To Everyone:
	haha @Kyle now we all know our fav person in group
20:27:23 From David Craig To Everyone:
	Is the 6 steps a generalization used in Network Analysis?
20:27:36 From Jessica Kennedy To Everyone:
	@Shel üòÇ
20:28:02 From Shilpa Murthy To Everyone:
	Swift for guest lecture
20:28:06 From Jeremy Boccabello To Everyone:
	I know set designer for Tyler Perry.  You are all now 3 nodes away from him.
20:28:11 From Thierry Azalbert To Everyone:
	birds of a feather....
20:28:27 From Omar Alsaid Sulaiman To Everyone:
	@Daniel, but I think the Erd√∂s number will just keep on increasing with time, since people with the least Erd√∂s number are dying, so with time +10 will be the minimum
20:28:56 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Omar, will have to think on it.
20:29:37 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Temporal degrees of separation isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôve considered.
20:29:53 From Omar Alsaid Sulaiman To Everyone:
	@Daniel imagine everyone who published with him died, there's 0% chance of someone new to get 1, and so on with time and more people dying, will be impossible to get "n"
20:30:06 From Mayda Alkhaldi To Everyone:
	What are other use cases or examples for homophile apart from the Facebook example?
20:30:07 From Gaetano Caolo To Everyone:
	it will be interesting to do it but in the real world and not virtually
20:30:11 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	I get the gist, I just don‚Äôt Grok it yet.
20:30:27 From Mayda Alkhaldi To Everyone:
	homophily*
20:30:29 From Thierry Azalbert To Everyone:
	Canada has a very peculiar pattern
20:30:38 From Soumyo Banerjee To Everyone:
	Population of the country should be considered?
20:30:45 From Frederik Vanaverbeke To Everyone:
	Yes, but that shows because it was decided to place specific countries close to each other on the axes, no?
20:30:49 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	Canadians are peculiar people. :)
20:30:54 From Vikram Baghel To Everyone:
	Don‚Äôt see India there..   :-/
20:31:04 From Andrew Carlson To Everyone:
	Just to clarify, the colors are number of connections? diameter of a certian component?
20:31:11 From Thierry Azalbert To Everyone:
	India is first row / column no?
20:31:21 From Uzair Akram To Everyone:
	Quite interesting! However, its data from 2011, internet access was quite low in a lot of countries
20:31:24 From Vikram Baghel To Everyone:
	Nah.. ID is not India.    IN. Is india
20:31:30 From Jens M√ºller To Everyone:
	Where is Germany?
20:31:33 From Uzair Akram To Everyone:
	ID = indonesia

	Look at the connection of the US and latin american counties, thats interesting results that shows the migration  rates I think
20:31:54 From Gaetano Caolo To Everyone:
	Is that graph consider all the world?
20:32:01 From Vikram Baghel To Everyone:
	Doesn‚Äôt look like all countries
20:32:07 From Vikram Baghel To Everyone:
	There are 100+ countries
20:32:10 From Vikram Baghel To Everyone:
	So its not complete
20:32:25 From Jens M√ºller To Everyone:
	Mayda, really?
20:32:29 From Petrino Ippolito To Everyone:
	How was the axis sort performed here? It looks like it was intentionally sorted by cluster group, seeing these large square regions of similarity. Or does that somehow naturally occur?
20:32:37 From Varuni Rao To Everyone:
	very interesting observation
20:32:39 From Mackenzie Hunt To Everyone:
	Does homophily only apply to networks of people? Would we not look at homophily for other types of networks?
20:32:49 From Santiago Arroyo To Everyone:
	What is random Edge?
20:32:57 From Tanou Diallo To All Panelists:
	Because their are friends to their relatives
20:33:21 From Mamta B To Everyone:
	Immigration is key to having US having many connections
20:33:31 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@petrino, likely geographic distance
20:33:49 From Luis Gaxiola To Everyone:
	can you explain more on random edge? please
20:33:54 From David Enck To Everyone:
	does random edge depend on proportions of the groups?
20:34:02 From Sophia Arellano To Everyone:
	@Mamta yess I saw this inmediatly, how interesting
20:34:57 From Julio Rojas To Everyone:
	it is not expected that most younger people use facebook so at random the % of connection are younger?
20:35:04 From Omar Alsaid Sulaiman To Everyone:
	Extrovert packs
20:35:04 From Anil Goud To Everyone:
	So highschool popularity on a graph
20:35:10 From Gerald Ortiz To Everyone:
	I'm curious how they clean this data, considering the amount people creating multiple account and bots
20:35:21 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	friendly people make friends with friendly people. This explains my social life perfectly.
20:35:23 From Sean Kurian To Everyone:
	So this is same as clustering ?
20:35:49 From David Enck To Everyone:
	so does this say there are more people with fewer friends and people with big networks have a larger number of people with small network to connect to?
20:36:20 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	Homophily also affects political situations within a working environment .. which affects promotions, bonuses, etc
20:36:32 From Valeria Herrera To All Panelists:
	What is the random edge? I couldn‚Äôt get the concept
20:36:46 From Uzair Akram To Everyone:
	Cambridge Analytica probably used network analysis to target voters back in 2016
20:36:46 From Gaetano Caolo To Everyone:
	what means the yellow dots in the diagonal of the matrix?
20:36:52 From Vikram Baghel To Everyone:
	Here you go guys -  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.4503.pdf
20:36:52 From Mamta B To Everyone:
	So true @Shel
20:37:09 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Geatano, nothing, it is self-association
20:37:15 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	@Gaetano - yellow = do you get along with yourself?
20:37:36 From Omar Alsaid Sulaiman To Everyone:
	@Shel you'd expect the line to be darker
20:37:36 From Mayda Alkhaldi To Everyone:
	So how would you read the y axis? On the left 2 graphs? (Fraction)
20:37:46 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	@Omar - lol
20:37:49 From Dom Lazara To Everyone:
	Why is the Random Edge graph different for neighbor age vs Random edge graph of neighbor's degree?
20:38:20 From Bernardo Serafin To Everyone:
	@Mayda, fraction of the total for each group type.
20:38:21 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	@Mayda, fraction x 100 is %

	Q: How Eigen vectors are calculated from Adjancey matrix?	A: We can build the covariance of the original adjacency matrix and perform an eigen value decomposition.
20:44:54 From Uzair Akram To Everyone:
	I don‚Äôt get the intuitive stuff in the degree centrality - can you please explain again?
20:45:07 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	could someone link our MIT group chat?
20:45:47 From Shilpa Murthy To Everyone:

	You mean Twitter isn't a criminal network?
20:47:52 From alberto chico To Everyone:
	Every time you disrupt a network it creates caos if you disrupt a criminal networks, could it create caos and violence  that can be counterproductive

	The MySpace worm is a live example of how networks can be used for bad
20:50:17 From Jens M√ºller To Everyone:
	What would be an example for image processing? Could I apply those methods also in that context?
20:51:34 From Mamta B To Everyone:
	Get to the sources by modification and impact..
20:53:14 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	so this is like a biological system where one species is stealing all the resources from another species.
20:54:08 From Johannes Oberhofer Lomeli To Everyone:
	Is it actually money or only representing the value of the substance?
20:54:24 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	certainly parallel to biological in the sense of applying pressure to an ecosystem and forcing it to adapt

	Same can be applied to covid infection network and changed between different phases of covid
20:55:18 From Swati Chandna To All Panelists:
	Why would the they not just catch all the people in Phase 1 when the network was so much smaller
20:55:53 From Shel Randall To Everyone:

	Can we plot the network on a time series ?
20:56:42 From Moderator - [Ankit Agrawal] To Everyone:
	Q: Why would the they not just catch all the people in Phase 1 when the network was so much smaller	A: The network wasn't smaller, the information about the network wasn't available. The visualization is just a representation of the information that the police had in that phase
20:56:55 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	if they arrest everyone early on, you only get the little fish
20:57:02 From Mamta B To Everyone:
	Probable Vs Confirmed through discovery
20:57:03 From Vidhya Shankarraman To Everyone:
	but #1 was the first to go after - because of high degree of centrality
20:57:09 From Neha Purohit To Everyone:

	Question: Eigenvectors seem to imply that it is a property of the original matrix that is used to describe the essence of what the matrix represents. Ex eigenvectors of covariance ‚Üí components that vary the most, eigenvectors of Adj ‚Üí centrality. Intuitively how can we think about this? Why does the eigenvector capture the essence in this way?

	Great Q Yasir - I‚Äôd like to know too
21:07:11 From David Craig To Everyone:
	I think you said this yesterday, are these network analysis operations to be found within the Python libraries?  Obviously, we still need to understand the software process and  output, but we are not usually writing code for network analysis?  Unless we have a specific parameter, outside of the commonly used model?

	Different types of centrality were discussed. It would be helpful to understand the differences
21:23:27 From Neha Purohit To All Panelists:
	1. How are eigen vectors are created from adjancey matrix?
	2. In Criminal case we the graph chnaged a lot from phase 1 to Phase 2 , so any analysis we did in phase 1 did not apply to phase 2 , But in social network once we analyse graph for a country we can use findings to another country  So we when do say this network is constant and data insight for the social network is good for furutre or for another location
21:23:43 From [GL Mentor] Niruppam To Everyone:
	Q: Can eigenvector centrality be determined in priority order, as in top 10? A: yes it can be
