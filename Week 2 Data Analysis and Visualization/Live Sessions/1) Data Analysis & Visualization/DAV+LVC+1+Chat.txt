19:19:29 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:

19:19:32 From Tanya Makeev To Everyone:
	are we talking about mammography early diagnosis or actual treatment?
19:19:36 From Shel Randall To Everyone:

19:19:44 From Srinivas Annam To Everyone:
	wonder if taking the x-ray and throwing away has legal risks
19:19:48 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	Tanya:  Mammogram = Treatment in this case.
19:19:52 From David Enck To Everyone:
	at some point if there is evidence that the treatment is much better don't trails stop and switch everyone to treatment?
19:19:53 From TP Singh To Everyone:

19:20:30 From Javier Eduardo Márquez Orjuela To All Panelists:
	Comparison between early detection positive results and early detection fake results
19:20:32 From Abhishek Majumdar To All Panelists:
	Can we look at ‘Re-randomization’ in the context of this case study?
19:20:37 From Moderator - Ankit Agrawal To All Panelists:
	@Yan Li: We can estimate a probability distribution for "chances of death" based on the profile.
19:20:41 From Ratna Dhavala To Everyone:
	So, this case study is a real world study and not a made up one right?
19:20:43 From ashish kumar To Everyone:
	what is large scale when you are talking about sample size?
19:20:58 From alberto chico To All Panelists:
	can you design an experiment as a patient to have a better idea of what work for you and have the results shared with your doctors. I have ms and i have a record of my symptoms, medications, treatments, and studios I would like to do some analisis on my data to see the correlation of what are the best actions to feel better
19:21:01 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	mammography is a screening test to check whether or not cancer exists - the question is it able to detect early enough that getting treatment after 'positive' impacts outcomes over alternative detection methods and timelines
19:21:16 From Hassan Alsawadi To Everyone:
	So, the control and treatment groups should be drawn from the same distribution on every variable?
19:21:33 From Tanya Makeev To Everyone:
	yes, that's what I thought - you can't treat with mammography, just detect early
19:22:03 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	Hassan - yes, but too many variables make the data sample too large to manage
19:22:35 From TP Singh To Everyone:
	Stratified randomization
19:22:35 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	It is a “Treatment” in the context of stats, but it is not a disease mitigating intervention to be rid of cancer.
19:22:37 From Nohelia Osorio To Everyone:
	Collect historical data on women with cancer, and study how each person discovered their cancer and whether getting a mammogram was helpful ??
19:22:38 From Abhishek Majumdar To Everyone:
	Can we explore the concept of ‘Re-randomization’ in the context of this case study?
19:22:47 From Valeria Herrera To All Panelists:
	Then the treatment is just over women that have insurance?
19:23:03 From Adithya Parvatam To All Panelists:
	We can collect data and curate it based on our usecase
19:23:09 From Jose Rojas To Everyone:
	How do you deal with the fact that not getting the treatment could be fatal for the people participating in a study like this?
19:23:19 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	you're not just testing got see if the test helps, but also if it hurts (x-rays, ya know)
19:23:22 From Thierry Azalbert To Everyone:
	If randomisation is within a group of people who signed up for a study, how do we check that there is no bias linked to the fact people did sign up?
19:23:27 From Raj Desikavinayagompillai To All Panelists:
	What will be the size of random samples
19:23:29 From Talal Rahim To All Panelists:
	What’s a good sample size?
19:23:37 From David Enck To Everyone:
	and we could also stratify based on age to assure that it does not confound the study, possibly?
19:23:44 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	@ Jose you don't know whether it helps or not without doing this type of analysis
19:24:03 From Soumyo Banerjee To Everyone:
	This is an observational study  (does not involve treating breast cancer)
19:24:05 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@David, that is usually done on a running basis after something is found to be even marginally beneficial.
19:24:09 From Sumeet Deshpande To Everyone:
	But was age a factor when these studies were started. Is it that age was determined to be a major factor after the study was completed to recommend mammography to women over a certain age?
19:24:42 From Moderator - Ankit Agrawal To All Panelists:
	@Daniel: 	Q: Don't we need to already know things about the population to be sure our sample is random	A: Statistical methods allow us to look at samples of data and make estimations about population data. Collecting population data is not always possible so we have to start with some assumptions and verify/ clarify those assumptions i.e. check if sample is random or biased, etc.
19:25:11 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	But the perception of the effects of x-rays on humans is likely based on older studies that involved only men,
19:25:33 From Julie Mann To Everyone:
	MRI speeds treatment possibilities tremendously faster than mammo .....
19:26:09 From Bec Volk To All Panelists:
	Wondering how the demographic of people given the exposure to the opportunities to be a part of such a trial may also be a covariant
19:26:13 From alberto chico To Everyone:
	Can you design an experiment with less control but apliable to everyday patients to see the relationships of the studies, habits, medications and a journal of symptoms?
19:26:26 From Pete B To Everyone:
	The question is ONLY about the difference in detection time correct? Treatment and control groups will both be detected at some point if the cancer exists, we want to know if the mean time difference is impactful
19:26:50 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	Is this total deaths, or only those w/i 5 years of diagnosis?
19:27:03 From Thierry Azalbert To Everyone:
	Can you please explain how the rates at calculated?
19:27:22 From Samit Thakur To Everyone:
	Treatment versus Control group (1.3 vs 2.0)
19:27:30 From Angalar Chi To Everyone:
	I'm assuming these are not age-adjusted rates...looks like crude rates
19:27:32 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	rate is average per 1000
19:28:06 From Srinivas Annam To Everyone:
	What does All Other column refer to?
19:28:18 From Kebron Negesse To All Panelists:
	Does this mean the treated group and control group don’t need to be the same size?
19:28:58 From Sidrat Tasawoor Kanth To Everyone:
	won’t the 10800 go into the control group?
19:29:10 From simona tenaglia To Everyone:
	should treatment and control be always the same?
19:29:12 From Jens Müller To All Panelists:
	Why do we add the Refused with the Screened ones?
19:29:17 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	People who refuse to participate have a bad attitude and are more likely to die of cancer. (We don't really know, because they refused to participate.)
19:30:26 From Julie Mann To Everyone:
	Did 'all other' who died, have breast cancer and died of a comorbidity?
19:30:41 From Mamta Byakod To All Panelists:
	How do we attribute breast cancer and other causes of death
19:30:49 From Talal Rahim To All Panelists:

19:33:54 From Shravan Bharathulwar To Everyone:

19:34:22 From Srinivas Annam To Everyone:

19:34:28 From Tanou Diallo To Everyone:
	They probably present other health issues
19:34:34 From Andiputranto Sukojo To Everyone:
	has more time and money
19:34:52 From Moderator - Ankit Agrawal To All Panelists:
	@Thierry	Q: Can you please explain how the rates at calculated?	A: It is normalized based on per 1000 women.
19:34:53 From Michael Miller To Everyone:
	Refused group is likely in lower education & income
19:34:59 From Sujasha Gupta To Everyone:
	How is the age distributed in screened vs refused group
19:35:13 From Claudio Chaves To Everyone:
	Screened people may be submitted into a different treatment once detected. Wouldn’t this fact change the study?
19:35:16 From Julie Mann To Everyone:
	Shouldn't ALL OTHER Rates be:  2.1, 3.8, 2.7 ...
19:35:22 From Todd Nitkin To All Panelists:
	1.1 vs 2
19:35:30 From David Craig To Everyone:
	What is the hypothetical, explanation for the control group death rate of 28 being in-between the two statistic, within the treatment group rate i.e. 21 & 38 respectively?
19:35:34 From Jakub Baranowski To Everyone:
	Doesn't that than mean that our control group is no longer equal to treatment?
19:35:56 From Lev Sukherman To Everyone:
	Can we look at 1.3 vs 2.0?
19:35:56 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	@Julie, no its rate/1000, so 21/1000 for example
19:36:05 From Samuel Wright To All Panelists:
	1.3 v 2.0
19:36:06 From David Enck To Everyone:
	interesting that the total rate for all other for Treatment was similar to the Total for Control, like the screened and refused underlying are represented in the Control
19:36:07 From Oumar Ndiaye To All Panelists:
	What’s is control in the table
19:36:07 From Johan Goedkoop To Everyone:
	answ is 1.3 vs 2.0 since 27 is closest to 28
19:36:10 From Samit Thakur To Everyone:
	The refusal that is happening within the control group, will also occur in the wider population group
19:36:41 From Varuni Rao To Everyone:
	so is it not important to look at source of data when making decisions about which variables to compare?
19:36:47 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	Isn’t this question essentially answered based on the initial hypothesis, not post-hoc looking at the data?
19:36:57 From Jingjing Jia To Everyone:
	But 1.3 vs 2 means there’s a difference?
19:36:59 From Shravan Bharathulwar To Everyone:
	What is the explanation for the lower 1.3?
19:37:03 From Yin Fang To Everyone:
	Yes, there are people in control group who might also have refused the screening
19:37:04 From Bec Volk To All Panelists:
	What is the “all other” column represent?
19:37:09 From Swati Chandna To Everyone:
	Within the control group do we not care how many people refused to be part of the control group?
19:37:12 From Megha Sharma To Everyone:
	As the people has refused so it is controlled group?
19:37:19 From Louis Reid To Everyone:
	you loss data on the refused
19:37:19 From Shravan Bharathulwar To Everyone:
	Does just undergoing a screening reduce the mortality?
19:37:22 From Jessica Kennedy To Everyone:
	keep the refused group in treatment as it represents behavior that would likely occur outside of a study (ie. if mammography is the standard screening)
19:37:38 From Naveen Ghaloo To Everyone:
	But in reality isn’t the sample actually 1.1?
19:37:39 From Raj Desikavinayagompillai To All Panelists:
	Was the 1.1 % part of 21% random samples?
19:37:47 From Glauco Stephan To Everyone:
	how can you guarantee total ramdomization if do not know the co-variant factors?
19:37:56 From Lalit Vyas To Everyone:
	how did we know the mortalities when the experiment was done ?
19:38:06 From Lalit Vyas To Everyone:
	or the results took 5 years to be finalized ?\
19:38:08 From Petrino Ippolito To Everyone:
	And so Screened vs Refused would just be a source of variance in the Treatment Group?
19:38:09 From Johannes Oberhofer Lomeli To All Panelists:
	that is helpful
19:38:09 From Pete B To Everyone:
	I understand that 27 and 28 for the other factors are closest, but it doesn't feel right that accounting 10000+ people who refused as mammogram participants
19:38:17 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	The control group likely has the same “refuser” types as well, but they were not measured directly to differentiate those from those who would follow up.
19:38:27 From Julie Mann To Everyone:
	Wouldn't death by breast cancer be a subset of All Other deaths?  How can you accurately compare death from 1 disease (breast cancer) vs death by everything else?
19:38:27 From Pete B To Everyone:
	Ah - not performed, but offered.
19:38:42 From Sharon Kuang To Everyone:
	Any specific reason to choose the sample size of 31000 ?
19:38:59 From David Enck To Everyone:
	This is an interesting point, the testing reflects the policy.
19:39:28 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	David - definitely
19:41:37 From Bernardo Serafin To Everyone:
	Treatment analysis are way more difficult to control than Intention-to-treat.
19:41:50 From Pete B To Everyone:
	Was the question not "Does mamm speed up detection enough to matter?" Did the question change after the data was collected to "Does offering a mamm help?"
19:41:51 From David Enck To Everyone:
	However, can't we use the treatment vs control as a best possible result to indicate that additional tests would be useful vs a waste of time
19:42:14 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Pete, the latter was the initial hypothesis.  Offering
19:42:18 From Moderator - Ankit Agrawal To All Panelists:
	@Michael	Q: Should the Refused be excluded from the Treatment group ?	A: These women still wanted to be part of the study, so we can monitor their decision for the treatment and whether they died or not.
19:42:54 From Julie Mann To Everyone:
	note:  this is 1960 study, 70 y/0
19:42:59 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	The former would require technical details of thresholds for diagnosis etc… when no such preliminary data existed.
19:43:14 From Samuel Wright To All Panelists:
	Offerring the the screening and for those who accepted helps because it becomes more then treatment it becomes an eduction as well
19:43:17 From Pete B To Everyone:
	Ah, thank you Daniel. I thought we were strictly going on the time saved in detection.
19:43:20 From Rishi Khanna To Everyone:
	Control group was not treated?
19:43:23 From Lalit Vyas To Everyone:
	does the gap of 0.7 also relate to the overall death rate gap of 1.0 ?
19:43:23 From Daniel Bautista To Everyone:
	Can you please explain why the refused group is part of the comparison
19:43:44 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Daniel, the test was “Does offering…”  the refused group were offered.
19:43:50 From EUNICE HERNANDEZ To Everyone:
	Why isn't "Refused" rate more similar to "Control" rate?
19:43:52 From Soumyo Banerjee To Everyone:
	Why are we looking at death rate ?
19:43:56 From owen sanford To Everyone:
	would  the qustion be better if the hypothesis added the word "contributed" to the reduction and not declarative?
19:44:04 From Mayda Alkhaldi To Everyone:
	How was 1.3 calculated?
19:44:05 From Marisol Santillan To Everyone:
	I have the same question as Pete, because the last slide said "does mammography speed up detection?
19:44:06 From Soumyo Banerjee To Everyone:
	Why not only detection?
19:44:15 From Johan Goedkoop To Everyone:
	because most of us were wrong
19:44:17 From owen sanford To Everyone:
	declarative that it does reduce
19:44:21 From Dom Lazara To Everyone:
	I understand Intent-to-Treat; but breast cancer is treatable. So it is assumed that a positive finding in a mammogram would lead to some treatment and some benefit. Would the same be true for a completely untreatable disease?
19:44:23 From Daniel Bautista To Everyone:
	Thanks @Daniel Gibson
19:44:26 From Michael Miller To Everyone:
	without knowing more details, I would expect the Refused death rate = the control group death rate
19:44:39 From Sharad Widhani To Everyone:
	Doesn't 1.1 Vs 2.0 makes more sense, given 16 ppl decided not to go through the test?
19:44:44 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Dom this was done a long time ago, prior to more effective treatments.
19:44:48 From Luis Gaxiola To Everyone:
	Still not clear to me why comparing 1.3 (screened and refused) versus the total (2.0), and not the 1.1 of Screened
19:44:56 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	Very nuanced points
19:45:01 From ashish kumar To Everyone:
	when we set up such a test, how do we understand what other criteria would help if the sample is good...i.e. if the treatment other death rate would have been different from 27, would we have gone ahead with this data set?
19:45:10 From EUNICE HERNANDEZ To Everyone:
	Why isn't "Refused" rate more similar to "Control" rate?
19:45:24 From Julie Mann To Everyone:
	@michaelmiller great point!1
19:45:28 From Rishi Khanna To Everyone:
	Control Group didn't undergo treatment?
19:45:42 From Samit Thakur To Everyone:
	So can it be assumed: ALWAYS compare the Treatment group with the Control group (because creating any sub-categories within the Treatment group would create a bias.)
19:46:22 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Samit, post-hoc “separation” is for learning to design the next study or to get those who could have been helped to accept care.
19:46:24 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	Samit 👍
19:46:27 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	control has people that would BOTH accept or refuse the test.
19:46:28 From Shannon Perez To All Panelists:
	Do a Binomial analysis.
19:46:40 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Joshua, yes.
19:46:46 From Angalar Chi To Everyone:
	The Control Group includes people who continue their usual course of treatment or no treatment
19:46:49 From Santiago Arroyo To Everyone:
	would it matter if the size of the control group is different of that of the treatment group?
19:47:07 From Bernardo Serafin To Everyone:
	As we said, as it's observational it could respond to other factors, right?
19:47:15 From Anil Celik To Everyone:
	Control group did not even see the ad campaign while refused group saw the ad and refused the screening which makes them completely different groups.
19:47:33 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	Were these all at the same site?
19:47:38 From Lalit Vyas To Everyone:
	more data is required about each group to infer these points..
19:47:55 From Julio Rojas To Everyone:
	would the fact of just offering the test creates higher awareness

19:50:27 From Lalit Vyas To Everyone:
	very good point to remember!
19:50:57 From Gabriel Signorelli To Everyone:
	It's expected only lower values in the mammography group… should we use one tailored?
19:51:17 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Leandro the variable is death vs life; binary.
19:51:42 From Gregg Ferguson To Everyone:
	Why are we working with count instead of percent?
19:51:45 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	@Daniel, up to the analyst, point is to use values that are easy to communicate/visualize/compare
19:52:15 From Sidrat Tasawoor Kanth To Everyone:
	how do you decide the 5% cutoff?
19:52:27 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Joshua I know that is how it is done, but it seems a more objective threshold would be warranted; especially if it ends up with “fractions” of people.
19:52:31 From Taylor Olson To Everyone:

19:52:34 From Lalit Vyas To Everyone:

	is the hypothesis that the true p for trt is equality true p for control
19:52:57 From Mamta Byakod To All Panelists:
	@Sidrat 5% is standard used. You can decide what it is based on sensitivity
19:53:02 From Prajwalita Baruah . To All Panelists:
	how do we define null hypothesis here
19:53:16 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@David, yes that is the null.
19:53:21 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	5% was arbitrarily selected by Ronald Fisher
19:53:39 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Shel, yes 1-in-20.
19:53:58 From David Enck To Everyone:
	this is a useful visual, however isn't the 63 a sample statistic?
19:54:14 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	different fields/studies might use a different value for significance
19:54:27 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@David, technially yes, because there is no previous data.
19:54:29 From Lev Sukherman To Everyone:
	Is it one tail test?
19:54:34 From Claudio Chaves To Everyone:
	Isn’t 39 deaths relate to treatment group instead of control?
19:54:51 From Helena Monteiro To Everyone:
	Which was the population sigma?
19:54:54 From Matthew Barletta To Everyone:
	H_0 deaths = 63	H_a deaths != 63
19:54:54 From David Craig To Everyone:
	So if the result of the treatment statistic was greater 0.01 on the density axiom then we would accept the Null?
19:54:57 From Filippo Caviglioni To Everyone:
	2 samples proportion test?
19:55:03 From Angelos Calogirou To All Panelists:
	This was a very clear hypothesis test. What would you do if the treatment was very close to the significance level??

19:55:35 From Lev Sukherman To Everyone:
	I don’t agree
19:55:43 From Lev Sukherman To Everyone:
	H_0 = 63
19:55:53 From Lev Sukherman To Everyone:
	H-a < 63
19:56:11 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Lev, it depends on how they formulated the question a  priori.
19:56:13 From simona tenaglia To Everyone:
	in Italy cancer screening are offered too
19:56:41 From Bernardo Serafin To Everyone:
	@Mathew, I think it be better sentenced as H_a: Deaths <63
19:56:43 From Fredy Vigo To Everyone:
	isn't the correct comparison between two proportions?
19:56:48 From Samantha Turner To All Panelists:
	@simona healthcare is not a human right in the US :-(
19:56:58 From Lev Sukherman To Everyone:
	@ Daniel if you want to calculate H-0 != H-a, you need to use two tail test
19:57:02 From Taylor Olson To Everyone:
	^ also confused about not using two proportions test
19:57:02 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	Yes
19:57:16 From Matthew Barletta To Everyone:
	yes thank you. not equal would be two tail. this is one tail and should be less than
19:57:21 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	It would be more robust, but they had a different hypothesis.
19:57:39 From Thierry Azalbert To Everyone:

19:57:41 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:

20:10:48 From Shane Miller To Everyone:

	that's a good first question, are humans involved? in the future we'll have to include is a robot(AI) involved?
20:17:20 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	divided or multiplied?  Slide is off
20:17:25 From Mamta Byakod To Everyone:
	🙂
20:17:45 From Shilpa Murthy To Everyone:
	@daneil p value < alpha/m
20:17:46 From Marisol Santillan To Everyone:
	i think you would solve for p-value
20:18:03 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Shilpa, I thought so, but d
20:18:09 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	dot = multiply
20:18:13 From Alisher Jardemaliyev To Everyone:
	they are all hypothesis testing models?
20:18:34 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	ah…nvm
20:18:40 From ahmed Tanveer To Everyone:
	what is i?
20:18:42 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	some physics experiments have a confidence level around 1 in a billion.
20:18:47 From Valeria Herrera To All Panelists:
	What do you mean about the number of hypothesis test performed?
20:18:53 From David Enck To Everyone:
	you can use for confidence intervals as well, at least for Bonferroni
20:18:56 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@shel so does toxicity
20:19:08 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	'i' is the current/particular test, 1,2,3...

	How to determine which one applies?
20:19:51 From Yan Li To Everyone:
	How to quantify the difference of 1% vs. 5% and make an informative decision?
20:20:19 From David Craig To Everyone:
	Which industries would even want to use the FDR?  What scenarios allow for a lower threshold?
20:20:25 From Santiago Arroyo To Everyone:
	You go one by one of the i tests?
20:20:51 From Vidhya Shankarraman To Everyone:
	How is Holm Bonferroni applied to the pizza example?
20:20:57 From Anil Goud To Everyone:
	Which corrections go with FDR and FWER again please?
20:21:07 From Moderator - Ankit Agrawal To Everyone:
	@Yan	How to quantify the difference of 1% vs. 5% and make an informative decision?	Depends on what error you are willing to accept. 5% is industry standard so is generally considered unless a different level is specified
20:21:23 From Varuni Rao To Everyone:
	when talking of multiple testing for corrections, are we testing the same hypothesis with different samples from same population?
20:21:31 From Petrino Ippolito To Everyone:
	@anil FDR - Benjamini-Hochberg, FWER - Holm-Bonferroni
20:21:41 From Anil Goud To Everyone:
	Thank you!!!!

20:30:01 From Samit Thakur To Everyone:
	Would have helped if the left-hand side also had the grayed/dotted map around it.
20:30:14 From Lalit Vyas To Everyone:
	does the size of point mean anything here on the map ?
20:30:31 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Lalit, maybe center of mass?
20:30:33 From David Enck To Everyone:
	what was the response that gave the color in the PCA?
20:30:34 From Alisher Jardemaliyev To Everyone:
	Turkey is not Europe
20:30:48 From Roman Neuhauser To Everyone:
	Can you have only 2 Principal Components in order to present the data two dimensional?
20:30:50 From Daniel Landeros To Everyone:
	Small part of Turkey in Europe
20:30:51 From Vikram Baghel To Everyone:
	What PC1 and PC2 axis mean here ?
20:31:05 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Roman, that is typical, but technically not required.
20:31:07 From Lalit Vyas To Everyone:
	principal component 1 and 2
20:31:09 From Uzair Akram To Everyone:
	@Alisher - seriously? That’s what you focus on?
20:31:15 From Anil Celik To Everyone:
	Turkey is both Europe and Asia. Turkey's European population is larger than many countries in Europe.
20:31:31 From Vikram Baghel To Everyone:
	I know full form.. I meant to ask what they represented 🙂
20:31:53 From Vikram Baghel To Everyone:
	Ok.. this slide
20:31:55 From Lalit Vyas To Everyone:
	almost like condensed components that really matter!
20:31:56 From David Enck To Everyone:
	can have as many PC as dimensions, however you want to pick the top  couple PCs that captures most of the variation, hence dimensional reduction
20:32:01 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	It's Euroturkasia.
20:32:08 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Vikram it is a blended vector of the variables with differing weightings.
20:32:22 From Bernardo Serafin To Everyone:
	Here the location of each point related with each other coincides with a geographical location, still in another context the lecture would be completly different right? More related to clusterization.
20:33:02 From Swati Chandna To Everyone:
	Can you explain this with an example?
20:33:05 From Alisher Jardemaliyev To Everyone:
	So basically we are 1) transforming multi dimensional to 1 dimensional 2) we are looking for largest spread or variance??
20:33:31 From Dom Lazara To Everyone:
	What does it mean to be orthogonal in a data set?
20:33:46 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Dom uniquely distinct.
20:33:51 From ashish kumar To Everyone:
	how many PCs do a large dataset typically returns and what's manageable?
20:33:52 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	orthogonal = perpenticular
20:33:53 From Talal Rahim To Everyone:
	When should be we PCA (an unsupervised dimension reduction method) instead of a a supervised dimension reduction method like Lasso?
20:33:55 From Uzair Akram To Everyone:
	How PCA is superior to lets see Lasso Regression or lets say  linear discriminant analysis (LDA)?
20:34:06 From Alisher Jardemaliyev To Everyone:
	orthogonal is probably visual representation of dimensions
20:34:09 From Bernardo Serafin To Everyone:
	@Dom, it is located in a 90 degree direction from the original vector, thus it has the biggest variation.
20:34:22 From Lalit Vyas To Everyone:
	when we have more than 3, we keep throw out components that are not in top 3 for representation purpose ?
20:34:26 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Dom in language, mutually exclusive
20:35:01 From Vikram Baghel To Everyone:
	Makes sense
20:35:34 From Awad Alomari,PE To Everyone:
	Is it a way of clustering the dataset?
20:35:56 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	more like taking a slice of the data set
20:36:06 From Moderator - Ankit Agrawal To Everyone:
	Q: So basically we are 1) transforming multi dimensional to 1 dimensional 2) we are looking for largest spread or variance??	A: We don't always transform data to 1 dimensions. Generally we want to capture at least 70% of total variation.
20:36:12 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Awad, yes.
20:36:48 From Moderator - Ankit Agrawal To Everyone:
	Q: What does it mean to be orthogonal in a data set?	A: Mathematically, the dot product of 2 vectors = ZERO
20:37:22 From Yan Li To Everyone:
	Is there a way to have these Q&As posted after the course? There’re some helpful answers here and just wonder
20:37:25 From Lev Sukherman To Everyone:
	Yes!!!
20:37:50 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	For recorded Zoom there is a .txt file for the chat.  Hopefully the mod’s will upload/link it.
20:37:51 From drashti darji To Everyone:

	same
20:37:56 From Jens Müller To Everyone:
	change
20:37:56 From Talal Rahim To Everyone:
	Yes, it will change because covariates need to be on the same scale
20:37:56 From Thiago Barros To Everyone:

20:37:57 From ashish kumar To Everyone:
	scale shouldn't matter
20:37:58 From Karolina Palka To Everyone:

20:37:58 From Mamta Byakod To Everyone:
	Same
20:37:59 From Varuni Rao To Everyone:

20:38:02 From Uzair Akram To Everyone:
	It will remain the same because the variation will remain the same
20:38:02 From Kebron Negesse To Everyone:
	Same because variability doesn’t change
20:38:02 From Sidrat Tasawoor Kanth To Everyone:
	should be same.
20:38:03 From Awad Alomari,PE To Everyone:
	changes!
20:38:03 From Gerardo Leon To All Panelists:
	Change
20:38:05 From Thierry Azalbert To Everyone:
	It will change
20:38:06 From Filippo Caviglioni To Everyone:
	chnage
20:38:06 From Raj Desikavinayagompillai To Everyone:
	Change
20:38:09 From Mackenzie Hunt To All Panelists:
	It becomes condensed but in the same direction
20:38:10 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	magnitude will change if not normalized
20:38:10 From Ahmed Abuelenein To Everyone:
	It is scaling a little bit
20:38:18 From Shannon Perez To All Panelists:
	Change
20:38:21 From Minya Liang To Everyone:
	not the same units
20:38:24 From Uzair Akram To Everyone:
	How come? The variation is the same? No? Despite the unit of scale?
20:38:25 From Todd Nitkin To Everyone:
	less difference in heights with metric
20:38:35 From Yin Fang To Everyone:
	Variance is larger if measured by feet?
20:38:45 From David Enck To Everyone:
	so run it on a standardized dataset?
20:38:48 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	1.3 is different than 30 prior to normalizing
20:38:48 From Yin Fang To Everyone:
	the opposite, sorry
20:39:00 From Daniel Bautista To Everyone:
	So, normalize all variables first?
20:39:05 From Moderator - Ankit Agrawal To Everyone:
	Q: How PCA is superior to lets see Lasso Regression or lets say  linear discriminant analysis (LDA)?	A: Lasso regression is a supervised learning & a statistical method for dimension reduction.	LDA takes the labels into account while doing dimensionality reduction.	So regression and LDA are supervised approach vs PCA is an unsupervised approach (not dependent on the target variable)
20:39:06 From Uzair Akram To Everyone:
	I see!
20:39:06 From David Craig To Everyone:
	So do we direct the software carrying out this analysis which variable to start with?
20:39:07 From Thiago Barros To Everyone:
	Is it not normalized?
20:39:08 From Sidrat Tasawoor Kanth To Everyone:
	shouldn’t we normalise?
20:39:12 From Lalit Vyas To Everyone:
	so before PCA we need to normalise
20:39:14 From Roman Neuhauser To Everyone:
	so PCA looks at absolute values and not relative?
20:39:21 From Awad Alomari,PE To Everyone:
	Q: Would this method be used for categorical variables?
20:39:49 From Filippo Caviglioni To Everyone:
	Stocks
20:40:08 From Thierry Azalbert To Everyone:
	To know if positive or negative correlation
20:40:08 From Filippo Caviglioni To Everyone:
	Variance = volatility
20:40:10 From Bernardo Serafin To Everyone:
	Growth rate on stocks
20:40:17 From Santiago Arroyo To Everyone:
	all data in same units
20:40:18 From Lev Sukherman To Everyone:
	If the data follow normal distribution
20:40:19 From Hajime Taniguchi To Everyone:
	Categorical value?
20:40:43 From Alisher Jardemaliyev To Everyone:
	but eur and usd, is it the same unit?
20:41:04 From fatimah alakeel To Everyone:
	@alisher good question
20:41:08 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Alisher convert is different than normalize
20:41:26 From Vidhya Shankarraman To Everyone:
	Convert to one common denomination (USD to eur)
20:41:30 From Talal Rahim To Everyone:
	Does it matter if observations are iid?
20:41:37 From Daniel Bautista To Everyone:
	Are there different normalization approaches for different contexts?
20:41:57 From TP Singh To Everyone:
	Will the correlation matrix not change when you change unit?
20:42:12 From Bernardo Serafin To Everyone:
	@Alisher, you almost never use nominal values in stocks, lots of collinearity and other types of problems.
20:42:22 From David Enck To Everyone:
	they won't be iid if they have correlation,
20:42:39 From Moderator - Ankit Agrawal To Everyone:
	Q: Are there different normalization approaches for different contexts?	A: Yes. RobustScaler for outliers, MinMaxScalar to normalize data between [0,1], StandardScaler to normalize data in a standard normal distribution
20:42:45 From Megha Sharma To Everyone:
	So for co variance matrix we have use only 1 variable?
20:43:01 From Daniel Bautista To Everyone:
	Thanks @Ankit
20:44:22 From TP Singh To Everyone:
	Is PCA like forward or backward selection in statistics?
20:45:02 From fatimah alakeel To Everyone:
	why do we need to go for 2 D?
20:45:11 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	Is the primary driver for 2D just for making figures?
20:45:25 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	for humans to visualize/compare
20:45:47 From Lalit Vyas To Everyone:
	find the no. of clusters
20:45:47 From Dom Lazara To Everyone:
	clusters of variation
20:46:00 From Alisher Jardemaliyev To Everyone:
	i need some time to digest this information, i find it a bit complicated for people who didn't major in statistics or mathematics. I only know how to use python and SQL functions to do all mathematical formulas for me 😄
20:46:04 From Lalit Vyas To Everyone:
	and similarity amongst them, yes
20:46:07 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Joshua in bio, many then follow up presentation with, “So what do the axes mean?”
20:46:12 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	No one answers...
20:46:15 From Moderator - Ankit Agrawal To Everyone:
	Q: Is PCA like forward or backward selection in statistics?	A: PCA is considered non-interpretable vs forward/backward selection are interpretable approaches. PCA changes the definition of the features i.e. linear combination of features vs Forward/ backward selection preserves the original definition of features
20:46:53 From Mamta Byakod To Everyone:
	@Alsher we are on the same page. Let me reach out to you on Slack.
20:46:55 From Moderator - Ankit Agrawal To Everyone:
	Q: why do we need to go for 2 D?	A: To be able to visualize the results.
20:47:24 From Lev Sukherman To Everyone:
	Can I use PCA and then tSNE?
20:47:36 From Michael Miller To Everyone:
	@Alisher - Completely AGREE, same here - Its a BIG jump for programmers who didn't major in Math
20:48:20 From Mamta Byakod To Everyone:
	@Micheal Let us create a slack channel so we can sound board.
20:48:20 From Alisher Jardemaliyev To Everyone:
	@Mamta okay 🙏
20:48:23 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	@Daniel, agreed to compare variable to variable spread/correlation is better answer
20:48:31 From Sophia Arellano To All Panelists:
	Hello! Why should we use PCA and when tSNE? Maybe with a simple example please
20:48:44 From Vikas Srivastava To Everyone:
	@alisher - we should try and make a group over Slack maybe and work with each other to understand the content that we just reviewed
20:48:55 From Mamta Byakod To Everyone:
	Agree @Vikas
20:48:56 From Marisol Santillan To Everyone:
	@mamta please add me too (:
20:48:57 From Vikram Baghel To Everyone:

20:48:58 From Megha Sharma To Everyone:
	Yes please
20:49:01 From Moderator - Ankit Agrawal To Everyone:
	Q: Can I use PCA and then tSNE?	A: Not sure of the purpose for doing this.
20:49:15 From Santosh Reddy To Everyone:
	Same here…its a big jump for programmers. I would hope to connect to other programmers to find easier ways to understand all this
20:49:25 From Jessica Kennedy To Everyone:
	yay, stats study group via slack!

20:49:53 From Mayda Alkhaldi To Everyone:
	I’d like to be added to the group please too
20:49:56 From Swati Chandna To Everyone:
	@Alisher, I am in the same boat. If you guys are creating a group please add me to that group as well, so we can all learn this together. Start from basics

	@Vikas add me too
20:50:00 From Sophia Arellano To All Panelists:
	@alisher me too please, maybe there is a YouTube channel that explains all this stats more simple and with example
20:50:01 From Moderator - Ankit Agrawal To Everyone:
	Q: Hello! Why should we use PCA and when tSNE? Maybe with a simple example please	A: PCA focuses on preserving and maximizing the variation in data across the new axes.	t-SNE focuses on the global representation of data and preserving that in lower dimensions
20:50:10 From Michael Miller To Everyone:
	I would love to review, but today my focus is completing the project and Quiz due tomorrow

	I posted the group link in slack also.. you can join from there also
20:53:08 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	you could spend an entire semester talking about just this.
20:53:31 From Talal Rahim To Everyone:
	tSNE is awesome
20:53:32 From Uzair Akram To Everyone:
	But do we really need the clusters? Cant we simply rely on the PCA and then for clustering, use K-means clustering?
20:53:36 From kim gagne To Everyone:
	brain overload, me too
20:53:45 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	Isn’t there a lonely “2” near the 1’s
20:53:47 From Hassan Alsawadi To Everyone:
	Also sometimes we don’t have labels and here PCA becomes really useless.
20:53:56 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	brain full. need coffee.
20:54:06 From Thierry Azalbert To Everyone:
	How would the tSNE be used for digits recognition?
20:54:08 From fatimah alakeel To Everyone:
	Can we get a break?
20:54:12 From Roman Neuhauser To Everyone:
	so tSNE is clearly superior
20:54:14 From Mayda Alkhaldi To Everyone:
	@ankita, where in slack did you post? I don’t see it in any channel
20:54:16 From Petrino Ippolito To Everyone:
	Don't worry if your brain hurts, just keep listening to build some mental scaffolding for the material to attach to when read and worked on
20:54:22 From Bas van Andel To Everyone:
	And K-Means Clustering is just another different method besides PCA & tSNE?
20:54:24 From Moderator - Ankit Agrawal To Everyone:
	If you just want an overall understanding, PCA is explained well at YouTube channel "Serraro Academy" and "Stats with Josh Stramer".		If you want the math, check out "ritvikmath"
20:54:27 From Kebron Negesse To All Panelists:
	When there are multiple clusters of the same variable, can we say that variable has the highest variability?
20:54:33 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Thierry, it is applied to the rasterized image of the written digits.
20:54:44 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	😀
20:54:59 From Awad Alomari,PE To Everyone:
	how can we interpret this output of tSNE example, Please
20:55:01 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	Are these approaches to solving the problems just trial and error driven?
20:55:02 From Prashant Bapuji To Everyone:
	when should we use one vs other ? from business case perspective?
20:55:04 From Rasha Elbeih To Everyone:
	rasha.elbeih@gmail.com
20:55:08 From Shel Randall To Everyone:
	tSNE is very cool … you can see how the AI would fall into this.
20:55:13 From Rasha Elbeih To Everyone:
	to add me to the group
20:55:23 From Petrino Ippolito To Everyone:
	@awad output of tSNE looks to have successfully clustered like-digits, if you see the labels
20:55:26 From Moderator - Ankit Agrawal To Everyone:
	Q: But do we really need the clusters? Cant we simply rely on the PCA and then for clustering, use K-means clustering?	A: That is usually the approach
20:55:29 From fatimah alakeel To Everyone:
	so the PCA for the visualisation, and the tSNE for what?
20:55:33 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Awad, it is simply: “the groups are separated from other numbers, but close to their own”.
20:55:35 From Uzair Akram To Everyone:
	Thanks @Ankit
20:55:35 From Angalar Chi To Everyone:
	Clusters are important for population surveys
20:55:49 From Ankita Srivastava To Everyone:
	@rasha You can join via link or ask any admit to add
20:55:54 From Felipe Loturco To Everyone:
	can you verify if link in the slide is correct?
20:55:59 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@fatimah, same purpose, but it just worked better with tSNE for this application.
20:56:01 From Alisher Jardemaliyev To Everyone:
	can we just use python for all these mathematical computations and not think about them, so we dont become depressed? :)
20:56:09 From Daniel Gibson To Everyone:
	@Alisher, yes.
20:56:13 From Tripureswar Chattopadhaya To Everyone:
	Can you please share an example of numerical data instead of image ?
20:56:30 From David Enck To Everyone:
	does tSNE give us the rule for how to define a group for a future observation of an 8x8 hand written number?
20:57:05 From Jean Vanlanduyt To Everyone:
	i am now close to develop a hand recognition to word software
20:57:05 From Daniel Bautista To Everyone:
	Is it ever useful to apply both?
20:57:41 From Daniel Bautista To Everyone:
	Like tsne on the result of PCA
20:57:44 From Jens Müller To Everyone:
	Very interesting stuff :-)
20:57:53 From Moderator - Ankit Agrawal To Everyone:
	Q: can we just use python for all these mathematical computations and not think about them, so we dont become depressed? :)	A: Yes. A library "scikit-learn" has a implementation of PCA built-in. It is still good to know the math but not required.
20:58:14 From Marisol Santillan To Everyone:
	this is very interesting, I need to do more diving on PCA and tSNE
20:58:16 From Peggy Hsieh To All Panelists:
	very good explanation, Caroline!
20:58:20 From Anil Celik To Everyone:
	scikit also has tsne.
20:58:23 From Uzair Akram To Everyone:
	Thank you!
20:58:32 From Moderator - Ankit Agrawal To Everyone:
	Q: i am now close to develop a hand recognition to word software	A: Hand recognition digit recognition has been solved with 99.99% accuracy
20:58:32 From Anil Celik To Everyone:
	thank you, Prof. Uhler!

21:03:04 From Bernardo Serafin To Everyone:
	At the beginning of the session Professor Uhler said "Sample size depends on the grade of effect you're interested to measure", could you elaborate a little further on this statement. Like some rule or proportion to which we should look forward on our sample size : measurable effect ratio?
21:03:11 From Talal Rahim To Everyone:
	A control group is when don’t give any medicine at all
21:03:22 From Talal Rahim To Everyone:

21:08:33 From Valeria Herrera To All Panelists:
	I have to go. Thank you for everything.
21:09:15 From Mehul Bhatt To Everyone:
	Can you please go over with PCA and tSNE?
21:09:32 From David Craig To Everyone:
	In Business Applications, do most business reports explicitly address the measures taken to avoid Type #1 vs Type#2 errors, or is this only found a technical analysis appendix

21:10:08 From Yan Li To Everyone:
	Is possible to post the question that we are going over right now in the chat area?
21:10:10 From Michael Wahnich To Everyone:
	@ Luis: I think it only means that they were OFFERED the mammography but declined - the test was whether offering mammography was efficient, not whether the mammography itself was
21:10:16 From Shravan Bharathula To Everyone:
	or zero correlation?
21:10:26 From Marisol Santillan To Everyone:
	I need to drop, thank you so much for answering the questions (:
21:10:53 From fatimah alakeel To Everyone:
	@moderator - pls take into consideration the pace is too fast for us
21:13:32 From Minya Liang To All Panelists:
	are the PCA axes required to be absolutely orthogonal? how to you ensure that? do you need to discard any columns whose correlation with the already chosen axes are > 0?
21:13:42 From Varuni Rao To Everyone:
	so pca o/p is used for t-sne?
21:13:45 From Sophia Arellano To All Panelists:
	Awesome, this explanation was perfect thanks!
21:13:58 From [GL Mentor] Niruppam Sharma To Everyone:
	pcs output can be used as input to tsne

	Thanks much! I need to drop out
21:15:18 From Luis Gaxiola To Everyone:
	@Michael Wahnich:  can I reach out to you later ?  I am interested on continuing this conversation.
21:16:08 From Joshua Coleman To Everyone:
	it would likely be helpful for many to outline supplemental materials that should be reviewed with the lectures for anyone that feels 'behind'
21:16:34 From Megha Sharma To Everyone:
	Can you give a real life example for PCA and tSNE?
21:17:32 From EUNICE HERNANDEZ To Everyone:
	I need to droput, thank you very much
21:17:38 From Samit Thakur To Everyone:
	Is the following assumption correct please? - When the performance-time is not an issue, for clustering problems: There is no harm in always doing PCA first and then tSNE next.
