[10/9/23, 11:34:09 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: I have raised it twice the mentor learning sessions are too fast paced

#statistics #data analysis #machine learning #10/9 lecture
[10/9/23, 12:03:00 PM] ‪+971 58 953 6461‬: I believe it was just elementary stuff that’s why it was easy to grasp. With today’s lecture, topics have started to get much heavier !
[10/9/23, 12:03:02 PM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: Still waiting haha
[10/9/23, 12:04:07 PM] ‪+1 (437) 288‑3670‬: I could watch him all day long lol
[10/9/23, 12:04:30 PM] ‪+971 58 953 6461‬: I did some pre reading and watched about an hour worth of content on eigenvectors and eigenvalues.. it wasn’t enough to say the least! Prof. spent 2-3 mins on mentioning about that.
[10/9/23, 12:04:57 PM] ‪+971 58 953 6461‬: So definitely needs a lot of self study if we want to get some juice out of this course.
[10/9/23, 12:05:08 PM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: Yes. I thought it was a bit too slow at first, but it's now the pace I'd like for the lectures
[10/9/23, 12:05:38 PM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: Agreed
[10/9/23, 12:06:01 PM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: I think we should reorient our focus as the main outcome of the course is to be able to over see the data not to run the equations. Equations should be run by the computer
[10/9/23, 12:06:04 PM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: I've heard Khan Academy has stuff on linear algebra. Haven't checked it out, so I don't know if it covers eigenvalues or not
[10/9/23, 12:06:30 PM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: We just need to understand what the equation outcomes
[10/9/23, 12:06:37 PM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: If there are any experts here or anyone who is more familiar, would be great to connect with you and just ask questions if that’s cool :)
[10/9/23, 12:06:42 PM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: And how to utilize this in our data analysis
[10/9/23, 12:08:35 PM] ‪+971 58 953 6461‬: +1.. could use some additional guidance.. the mentored learning sessions are utterly uninspiring! Could sleep through it without any effort! 😴
[10/9/23, 12:09:58 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: In the great learning platform?
[10/9/23, 12:10:05 PM] ‪+32 491 19 42 21‬: Guys this course is not for complete beginners, it’s clearly for professionals in data analytics or data science who want to expand their portfolio and make their CV look better. And of course for people with technical background(math, engineering, statistics). I think they won’t find it complicated at all. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/9/23, 12:10:13 PM] ‪+1 (314) 827‑8522‬: yes
[10/9/23, 12:11:04 PM] ‪+1 (437) 973‑9491‬: But it was sold differently, if you have programming experience you would do great
[10/9/23, 12:11:09 PM] ‪+1 (437) 973‑9491‬: Nada!
[10/9/23, 12:11:22 PM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: I'm not sure who it's for. I'm in data analysis 6+ years and I'm getting lost
[10/9/23, 12:11:35 PM] ‪+32 491 19 42 21‬: On what?
[10/9/23, 12:11:40 PM] ‪+32 491 19 42 21‬: Stats?
[10/9/23, 12:11:41 PM] ‪+1 (314) 827‑8522‬: If you start with Dr Sarkar's introduction course - you will be a lot at ease - I have been a teacher/mentor myself so I can assure you that that's a great place to start
[10/9/23, 12:11:41 PM] ‪+971 58 953 6461‬: Guys, do we have a LinkedIn group for our cohort already ?
[10/9/23, 12:12:25 PM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: True, but there are concepts that not everyone have necessarily covered and some are at different points of their career. All this factors in. I’m in data analytics but not science so there’s not a huge overlap. But it’s still possible to learn 😇
[10/9/23, 12:12:27 PM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: Some of the lecture today, some of the prereading. Not last week's stuff
[10/9/23, 12:12:46 PM] ‪+32 491 19 42 21‬: Data analysis is way less complicated than data science, data scientists need much more knowledge of python, math and statistics
[10/9/23, 12:12:50 PM] ‪+1 (314) 827‑8522‬: so please don't go overwhelmed - if you follow the order of the sessions and watch those videos - I am sure you will keep up  - and i guess the rest of us are here to help wherever needed ‎<This message was edited>

[10/9/23, 12:14:27 PM] ‪+32 491 19 42 21‬: Data analysts only use Tableau, Power BI, SQL and a bit of Python. They don’t need complicated statistics for machine learning algorithms ‎<This message was edited>

Whereas those who didn’t (refused or control group), may or may not have eventually gotten a mammogram (but that would be based on a symptoms and doctors prescriptions)… and comparison is not between those who got the treatment and those who didn’t.

- Here treatment means offer of getting mammogram done
- Screened means the number of women who accepted the offer and got screening done
-refused is the number of those who refused the offer
-question is that if the offer to get screening done made a difference
- since screened and refused together is the population of women who were offered the total or 1.3 is considered.
- this value makes sure the data is not biased since women who were screened and those who refused came from different segments of society

[10/9/23, 4:20:19 PM] ‪+1 (703) 944‑1994‬: My issue is do they want all outputs placed somewhere
[10/9/23, 4:28:43 PM] ‪+57 316 2475846‬: I put all the question answers as the " business overview", but not like a Q&A, I did it like showing facts (you can support some with the histograms and boxplots).

 Then, I mentioned the "key findings and insights" which are the analysis of those previous contents of the "business overview". 

Then, I talked about the "key takeways" which are the conclusions or key messages of the whole presentation.  

Finally, you can include some recommendations or solutions to the problems identified during the  data analysis.

Keep in mind that those " business overview, key findings, key takeways and solutions" that I mentioned, are the way that is recommeded to develop the low-code version
[10/9/23, 4:30:37 PM] ‪+1 (408) 908‑0220‬: Great. Thank you!

[10/9/23, 4:47:25 PM] ‪+91 97390 32951‬: How to download the Jypiter code into html format?
[10/9/23, 4:47:40 PM] Han: Be careful with ChatGPT.  It gave me an answer which wasn’t one of the choices.  I had to actually play around in Excel to get the right answer.
[10/9/23, 4:48:12 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Anyone could confirm answer to question 9?
[10/9/23, 4:48:31 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: It’s 6937.50?
[10/9/23, 4:48:45 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Thanks I’ll check the answer over here
[10/9/23, 4:48:46 PM] Han: I followed this link: https://olympus.mygreatlearning.com/courses/87793/files/8974491?module_item_id=4700361
[10/9/23, 4:49:03 PM] ‪+91 97390 32951‬: Thanks
[10/9/23, 4:49:28 PM] ‪+1 (781) 296‑2531‬: I got 29.24%. It's percentage of orders. Can't be more than 100
[10/9/23, 4:49:47 PM] ‪+506 7209 1200‬: Question 9 from where? Quizz or full code project?
[10/9/23, 4:49:54 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Full code
[10/9/23, 4:50:08 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Yes sorry my bad
[10/9/23, 4:50:17 PM] ‪+1 (408) 908‑0220‬: Go to file then choose download as and pick html
[10/9/23, 4:50:21 PM] Han: Got the same (Q9 in Full code)
[10/9/23, 4:50:52 PM] ‪+506 7209 1200‬: Yeah, I got this result too
[10/9/23, 4:53:02 PM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: In general chatgpt is not great at numbers and logic and can hallucinate. It’s good for content/writing and spitting out code. I’d be very careful with actual numbers but code can be pretty reliable.
[10/9/23, 4:53:51 PM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Same
[10/9/23, 4:54:30 PM] ‪+1 (203) 727‑2789‬: Would appreciate if someone could tell me what I am doing wrong here as I have more than 4 restaurants in my result for question 13.

[10/9/23, 4:55:58 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: I got the same value now, thanks 😊
[10/9/23, 4:56:00 PM] Han: Check to make sure that you exclude “Not given” ratings since those should be treated as NaN or null. At least that what I did.
[10/9/23, 4:56:34 PM] ‪+1 (704) 962‑4113‬: I got 29.24 also
[10/9/23, 4:56:35 PM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: You’re not excluding rating = ‘Not given’ in the counts
[10/9/23, 4:56:55 PM] ‪+1 (203) 727‑2789‬: I already dropped the rows with rating not given
[10/9/23, 4:57:39 PM] ‪+1 (704) 962‑4113‬: For long code, any suggestions what to use for #6 for charts, etc
[10/9/23, 4:57:57 PM] Han: I use Google CoLab and that option is not available (download as HTML).  I followed the instructions in the link I posted earlier and that worked for me.
[10/9/23, 5:02:43 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: For Q6 I used only histogram, Boxplot and countplot.
[10/9/23, 5:03:13 PM] ‪+1 (781) 296‑2531‬: I used histogram and box plots
[10/9/23, 5:14:18 PM] ‪+1 (704) 962‑4113‬: Thanks
[10/9/23, 5:16:33 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: You can look into low code to get a sense.
[10/9/23, 5:18:23 PM] Han: I got the same sum/mean you did.  However, my count is 17.  So, it should have been excluded since it has less than 50 ratings.
[10/9/23, 5:20:47 PM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Its only supposed to be a report not slides
[10/9/23, 5:28:19 PM] ‪+1 (732) 762‑5126‬: Are people in US planning to get online at 9:30 est?
[10/9/23, 5:29:26 PM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: Do we have a choice 😅
[10/9/23, 5:29:50 PM] ‪+1 (732) 762‑5126‬: 😁

[10/9/23, 5:30:24 PM] ‪+1 (704) 962‑4113‬: I assume your referring to 930am EST for live classee ? 
If so yes
[10/9/23, 5:31:03 PM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: From what I understood they do want graphs to be placed, and I remember reading it somewhere where they said we should not be pasting any code in the report
[10/9/23, 5:37:01 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: For full code version, what kind of analysis you did for question 12?
[10/9/23, 5:37:32 PM] ‪+1 (437) 288‑3670‬: Yes
[10/9/23, 5:38:08 PM] ‪+1 (437) 288‑3670‬: Thiago Barros is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.

[10/9/23, 5:52:21 PM] ‪+51 964 257 681‬: What is the due date for submitting the foodhub project? (Just checking, according to my dashboard is oct 10th 4am EST)
[10/9/23, 5:53:06 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: @14372883670 , I am catching up still with stuff, so I don't think I will make it for this meeting... are you guys going to record it?
[10/9/23, 5:58:52 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Same here
[10/9/23, 6:00:00 PM] ‪+1 (437) 288‑3670‬: I'm just trying to get together with you all and discuss about the quiz and assessment. Going through the assessment all day long in the full code and will leave the quiz to tonight when we are in the meeting
[10/9/23, 6:00:06 PM] ‪+971 58 953 6461‬: Just noticed the sequence is different for count and rating. Can easily get confused and combine incorrect counts and rating in observations.
[10/9/23, 6:02:00 PM] ‪+1 (437) 288‑3670‬: If it does allow it, yes, I'll record it
[10/9/23, 6:03:12 PM] ‪+1 (646) 331‑2026‬: anyone else get stuck on qestion 13 for the project
[10/9/23, 6:03:45 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Thanks @14372883670 … I had a family emergency and got some extension for the assignments, but I am really panicking because I read this conversation and I am not understanding (I am delayed in all previous deliveries and I just have a couple of days to deliver), but I know everything being said here is important... but I have no idea what this is about.
[10/9/23, 6:06:00 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: @14372883670 , what I am trying to say here, is that I started everything almost with a whole week delay.  I am literally working day and night trying to catch up on all this, but still.
[10/9/23, 6:08:23 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: @19084771326 I recommend you to download the class materials (slides for week 1 and 2) and give them a review and this that you will be ready for quiz 1 and 2
[10/9/23, 6:08:30 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Both are really easy
[10/9/23, 6:08:36 PM] ‪+1 (419) 819‑9037‬: I was stuck. The mistake i was doing was not filtering rows for which rating is not given
[10/9/23, 6:08:50 PM] Han: Ummm … I think Quiz 2 (Statistics for Data Science) was due at 4 PM today.
‎[10/9/23, 6:09:11 PM] Han: ‎image omitted
[10/9/23, 6:09:14 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: And about the project I am stuck with question 12 haha so maybe I could help with the rest
[10/9/23, 6:09:36 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: 12 and 13
[10/9/23, 6:10:09 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: I went through all the videos related to Week 1 … totally unaware there were slides!!! :D … I still need to go through Week 2 material
[10/9/23, 6:10:14 PM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: It says 10th 4am for me eat
[10/9/23, 6:10:32 PM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Est* probably standard time differences
[10/9/23, 6:10:48 PM] Han: Yeah, I’m in Eastern Time Zone
[10/9/23, 6:10:56 PM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: For me it says today 4:00 PM Est
[10/9/23, 6:11:39 PM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Weird maybe different due dates 🤷‍♀️
[10/9/23, 6:11:51 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Related to question 13, I’m not understanding what it means by “rating count” could I get some help? 🙏🏻
[10/9/23, 6:11:59 PM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: First you need to remove the ones that are not rated and then do the mean for restaurants that have a rating count more than 50
[10/9/23, 6:12:44 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Thanks you answer my question here 🙌🏻
[10/9/23, 6:12:51 PM] Han: For me, the project is due Oct. 10th @ 4PM.  Quiz 2 was due today @ 4 PM (times in Eastern)
[10/9/23, 6:13:25 PM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: Rating count is basically total number of orders where rating is given by restaurants. You then have to check their  average  rating
[10/9/23, 6:13:40 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: Guys,  quick one.  Please remind me if for all these quizzes etc.  is there over all minimum we need to score to clear this course or what ?
[10/9/23, 6:13:45 PM] ‪+1 (419) 819‑9037‬: Rating count is total number of ratings present for a restaurant
[10/9/23, 6:13:58 PM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: I put the code for this in the group and you can scroll up
[10/9/23, 6:14:01 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: as in,  do they fail ppl if not scored min X marks over all ?
[10/9/23, 6:14:14 PM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: For project it says 4:00 Am Est on Oct 10th
[10/9/23, 6:14:21 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Thanks!!
[10/9/23, 6:14:25 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: attendance wise i know they are tracking and need some minimum.
[10/9/23, 6:15:13 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Yes, there are obligatory but not the ones after the videos
[10/9/23, 6:15:22 PM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: @593997050664
[10/9/23, 6:15:27 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Just the quiz week 1 and week 2
[10/9/23, 6:16:25 PM] Han: Q12 is kinda open ended … explore/plot two columns like restaurants vs total delivery times; total delivery times vs. weekend/weekday; etc.
Q13: (1) remove the “not given” ratings; (2) convert ratings column to int64; (3) extract list of restaurants with > 50 ratings then get the mean.
[10/9/23, 6:17:19 PM] Han: You’re right … 4AM on the 10th.
[10/9/23, 6:18:57 PM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: For a minute I was happy thought I gained 12 hrs :)
[10/9/23, 6:19:25 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: how do I reach out to get a ticket for support?  I attended today's live lecture but on the dashboard it says I didn't ...
[10/9/23, 6:19:31 PM] Han: Sorry about that … 😁
[10/9/23, 6:20:49 PM] Han: Either (1) from the dashboard, click on “Need assistance” or (2) Slack channel and tag your program manager.
[10/9/23, 6:26:28 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Thank you!!
[10/9/23, 6:28:45 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: Thank you!

[10/9/23, 6:53:33 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Hi! Sorry but anyone knows to convert the  google colab to html?
[10/9/23, 6:54:24 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: I’m trying with the command that says on great learning but its not working

[10/9/23, 6:57:21 PM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: !jupyternbconvert-- to html 'ProjectNotebook.ipynb'
There needs to be a space in 'to html'
[10/9/23, 6:59:28 PM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: I think you can open this on Anaconda in the cloud and convert to HTML using that. I haven’t tried it myself
[10/9/23, 7:00:11 PM] Han: These instructions worked for me:

[10/9/23, 7:00:27 PM] ‪+971 58 953 6461‬: !jupyter nbconvert —to html ‘notebook_name.ipynb’
[10/9/23, 7:01:01 PM] ‪+971 58 953 6461‬: When you copy-paste the code, it doesn’t have the correct spacing.
[10/9/23, 7:09:50 PM] ‪+1 (914) 610‑5891‬: Can you make sure there are no spaces in the file name or I believe you an add a + for spaces
[10/9/23, 7:09:52 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: Finally getting to this.. 🫣 after finish pending videos   starting with initial list of questions
[10/9/23, 7:10:50 PM] ‪+1 (914) 610‑5891‬: It's not as bad Vikram. You can pull ot off. Concentrate on hypothesis testing and basics
[10/9/23, 7:12:03 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: tx..  so in food_order csv..  datatypes for few are object..  before proceeding further me trying to string'fy them.  Seems to not work.

[10/9/23, 7:14:02 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: This is what i am putting after Q2..  to explain data type and fixing which aren't right.     did anyone do same ?
[10/9/23, 7:16:09 PM] ‪+1 (914) 610‑5891‬: Sorry I was thinking about the stat quiz.
[10/9/23, 7:20:12 PM] Han: Just leave them as object types.  Don’t worry about them.
[10/9/23, 7:20:16 PM] ‪+1 (437) 288‑3670‬: I didn't do that. Why are you doing that?
[10/9/23, 7:20:50 PM] Han: You can still do string comparisons even if they are object types.
[10/9/23, 7:20:50 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: its taking so long to convert, is that normal?
[10/9/23, 7:23:38 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: "ot"?

[10/9/23, 7:25:54 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: if anyone have the same problem, this code finally worked for me
[10/9/23, 7:27:47 PM] ‪+1 (732) 762‑5126‬: May be you have multiple notebooks open? That might use up resources and block some runs
[10/9/23, 7:35:22 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: coz it felt right..   but if things work without it so i will skip..
[10/9/23, 7:50:21 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: https://pbpython.com/pandas_dtypes.html

there is no str type for pandas.  object type is the alternative
[10/9/23, 7:51:31 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: Ty.  i was referring some related stack overflow on this as well.     interesting stuff
[10/9/23, 7:57:17 PM] ‪+32 491 19 42 21‬: Honestly the statistics that we learn is not that hard, once you understand, I guess it’s what they learn during first few classes in bachelor of statistics 😂🙏
[10/9/23, 7:59:44 PM] ‪+1 (646) 331‑2026‬: We can do it guys. No one give up!
[10/9/23, 8:03:24 PM] ‪+1 (617) 513‑9836‬: $1486.32
[10/9/23, 8:08:10 PM] Han: $6,166.30.  I verified it by importing the data into Excel. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/9/23, 10:18:17 PM] Han: There should be a space between "jupyternbconvert" and "--tohtml"
[10/9/23, 10:24:26 PM] ‪+1 (704) 247‑0706‬: @12013153086 - looks like you are going with full code version… see if Q13 is same as for low code. (mine is low code).
[10/9/23, 10:26:12 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: Ty.  I’m ok writing code,  I chose full code intentionally.  Just new to pandas and stuff around it.
[10/9/23, 10:26:59 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: Now dinner break and will be back to polishing report
[10/9/23, 10:27:31 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: This Watsapp group really was great idea, why dint we make on first week 😬
[10/9/23, 10:29:44 PM] ‪+1 (704) 247‑0706‬: still not too late !!! We have many more tough weeks ahead 😜
[10/9/23, 10:34:35 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Hello guys, a "little" behind in the discussion, regarding Q3, what is the most appropriate thing to do with the "Not given" rates?
[10/9/23, 10:34:41 PM] ‪+1 (437) 288‑3670‬: Is anyone using JupyterLite for the project?
[10/9/23, 10:37:04 PM] ‪+1 (437) 288‑3670‬: Not given is a kind of data. They're not "missing values"
[10/9/23, 10:41:02 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: So, regarding Q3 there are no "missing values" then? So for the part of this same question "If yes, treat them using an appropriate method." there is no need to treat them?
[10/9/23, 10:42:08 PM] ‪+1 (781) 296‑2531‬: Yes, since there are no missing values, no special handling required
[10/9/23, 10:43:49 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: TY!
[10/9/23, 10:44:07 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: I think it depends on the aim you have.  I analyzed with both replacing it with 0 or removing it.  It only affects the average calculation - so Question 13.
[10/9/23, 10:44:50 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: So, how did you answer that one, Q13?
[10/9/23, 10:48:06 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: Made both the replacing 0 version and removing version.  But, the replacing 0 version had no restaurants that fulfill the combined condition.
[10/9/23, 10:49:32 PM] ‪+506 7209 1200‬: "Not given" is still considered as categorical. So the best way for Q13 is converting the values with "Not given" as numbers. There is a function in pandas doing so, 

pd.to_numeric(df['rating'], errors="coerce") 

coerce means if there is an invalid value, then it will convert it to NaN (NonNumerical)
[10/9/23, 10:51:02 PM] ‪+506 7209 1200‬: Converting it to zero would work if they are filtered later, but, thinking in a way of analysis, zero means the restaurant is terrible, but "Not given" could have been a 5
[10/9/23, 10:53:29 PM] ‪+506 7209 1200‬: Now, a rating could start from 1 as the worst, so 0 would be fine then.
[10/9/23, 10:54:00 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: Vice versa It could also be a zero too.  You might be angry and not rate(=meaning 0). So it might be a extreme estimation(everyone in Not given=0) but there is a slim posibility so I ran a calculation anyway.
[10/9/23, 10:55:28 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: That was a very interesting way of approaching it.
[10/9/23, 10:55:51 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Thanks for the answer... so, are you presenting both versions?
[10/9/23, 10:57:09 PM] ‪+506 7209 1200‬: Only full code
[10/9/23, 10:58:26 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Hehehe, sorry, misunderstanding.  No, I meant, if @18573818612  is presenting both versions of what he commented for Q13 😊
[10/9/23, 11:01:37 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: I am on full code version, so I made conditional branch(what programmings are good at) and ran both. printed out the results with print().  And in observations, descripted the facts that came out.
[10/9/23, 11:12:36 PM] ‪+1 (419) 819‑9037‬: How to convert ipyb file from google colab to html successfully?
[10/9/23, 11:17:00 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: I confirmed this by code but, I am using the to_numeric(column, error="coerce") method in my code and it is the same as excluding(dropping) NaN(Not given) rows, if you use the Numpy method  .mean() or manually calculate with sum/total row counts ‎<This message was edited>
[10/9/23, 11:21:35 PM] ‪+974 7730 3977‬: Morning—- best option export the notebook from Colab, then import it using Juypter finally save as “HTML”
[10/9/23, 11:29:10 PM] ‪+506 7209 1200‬: 1. Download the .ipyb file into your computer
    2. Create a new Notebook in Codelab
    3. Upload the .ipyb
    4. Run the following !jupyter nbconvert --to html 'name_of_the_project.ipynb'
    5. Click on the folder icon to the right, select the file right click, download as html
[10/9/23, 11:56:19 PM] ‪+1 (781) 296‑2531‬: Should we submit the html or add all the content into the report template? This is for full code version?
[10/9/23, 11:57:11 PM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: Html for full code
[10/9/23, 11:58:39 PM] ‪+1 (781) 296‑2531‬: Thank you. Should we upload from the project discussion forum? I did that and it's showing up in the comments
[10/9/23, 11:59:26 PM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: No, on the page with all the project details there is a button at the bottom for uploading the doc
[10/10/23, 12:01:23 AM] ‪+1 (650) 374‑8786‬: Are they going to extend deadline for quiz 2? Hope they do it as I hvnt done with the statistics
[10/10/23, 12:02:52 AM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: I think you’d have to contact the program manager
[10/10/23, 12:04:59 AM] ‪+1 (781) 296‑2531‬: Thank you. It was confusing. I saw a few other people submit in the project discussion forum comments section as well. Unfortunately I can't delete the comment with my html file

[10/10/23, 3:05:39 AM] Han: That's for the low code version.  You need to write a report using that template and submit it as a PDF.
[10/10/23, 3:05:52 AM] ‪+91 97390 32951‬: Okay.
[10/10/23, 3:53:51 AM] ‪+1 (419) 819‑9037‬: Hi one question , have submitted the html file for the project 
What needs to be done in discussion form? I am not clear what it “deadline for discussion form” means
[10/10/23, 3:55:14 AM] ‪+971 56 271 1606‬: I think discussion forum u can just post comments if u want help from the community. Deadline just stating the forum will be closed for asking more questions regarding the project
[10/10/23, 3:55:41 AM] ‪+1 (419) 819‑9037‬: Thanks 😊

It was tough to understand and to remember all functions and apply on correct questions. 

Yesterday's lecture was like day dream don't know what's going on but I believe after reviewing the lecture videos might it will clear all doubts from yesterday's lecture.
[10/10/23, 8:17:25 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Not weekday

[10/10/23, 8:27:55 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Correct
[10/10/23, 8:28:15 AM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: I agree that’s my understanding as well
[10/10/23, 8:28:37 AM] ‪+1 (704) 247‑0706‬: For some reasons, it’s showing Mandatory for me and marked as absent ( I dint attend)… the reason why I ask is due to work schedule it’s hard for me join weekday classes.
[10/10/23, 8:29:19 AM] ‪+1 (704) 247‑0706‬: I was assured, weekday sessions are optional and my attendance dropped down.
[10/10/23, 8:29:31 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Ofcourse everyone here is working
[10/10/23, 8:29:36 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: This is correct
[10/10/23, 8:29:42 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Only weekends are graded
[10/10/23, 8:29:48 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Thats all i am saying
[10/10/23, 8:30:00 AM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: We need to ask them. I will not be able to attend many sessions either
[10/10/23, 8:38:22 AM] ‪+1 (704) 247‑0706‬: Same here … I’m a bit frustrated looking at attendance dashboard. Even I see program managers are not responsive
[10/10/23, 8:38:27 AM] ‪+1 (703) 944‑1994‬: Where do we find week 3 lessons and assignments? Been hunting for it
[10/10/23, 8:42:33 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: You need to go to courses
[10/10/23, 8:42:49 AM] ‪+1 (703) 944‑1994‬: Yeah. They are all over the place
[10/10/23, 8:42:54 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Select foundations for data science
[10/10/23, 8:43:15 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: And then itll load on the left side you get to select what you want to view
[10/10/23, 8:43:17 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Agree
[10/10/23, 8:45:40 AM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: There is no week 3
[10/10/23, 8:46:07 AM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Foundations for data science it’s just a 2 week course, then we started with data analysis and visualization
[10/10/23, 8:46:39 AM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: That’s another course and we have live sessions and previews readings to review
[10/10/23, 8:46:59 AM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Hope that answers your question @17039441994
[10/10/23, 8:47:57 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: Overall, I feel the greatlearning is low managed service.  I am surprised this is like the fifth cohort.  The web site is inconsistent.  Scheduals are changed or announced at the last minute.    Doesn’t have mistake review features and so on.  Also managers are slow responsive.  🫠
[10/10/23, 8:51:43 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Are you referring to yesterday’s class?
[10/10/23, 8:52:53 AM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Yes, that was part of the course data analysis and visualization
[10/10/23, 8:54:01 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: I was told the same a couple of months ago, during the sign-up process for the course, when they saw me I was hesitating to sign up for the course, and they assured me that I could watch the session videos at night time.  I mean... I work from home, so I can "dodge" some work meetings in the morning, but I also have work meetings that are mandatory, and they take place at the same time than the lectures.
[10/10/23, 8:54:36 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Anyone here who submitted the low-code version?
[10/10/23, 8:54:49 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Ok good thanks
[10/10/23, 8:55:08 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: I did
[10/10/23, 8:56:19 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: I did
[10/10/23, 8:57:38 AM] ‪+1 (704) 247‑0706‬: I agree with you … that’s my observation soo far. Program manager is not available.
[10/10/23, 9:22:32 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: I have the same experience
[10/10/23, 9:32:06 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: After all this I am still alive 😀.. It is good, at least we only have quiz next week. 2nd quiz and project were a lot of things in one week.
[10/10/23, 9:44:17 AM] ‪+49 1511 6898514‬: @16472786277 - are you referring to the short videos within Python for Data Science or something else?
[10/10/23, 9:50:23 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Yes
[10/10/23, 9:50:30 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Those are helpful
[10/10/23, 9:50:39 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Better than mentor learning sessions
[10/10/23, 9:50:54 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Both last sessions were at covered at speed of lightning!
[10/10/23, 9:51:48 AM] ‪+49 1511 6898514‬: I agree, it was very hard to follow
[10/10/23, 10:23:49 AM] ‪+1 (732) 762‑5126‬: Hi All, it was a frenzy to get the week 2 project and quiz. Lot of good material but lack of enough time to understand it thoroughly. 
Will be moving in to the lecture from yesterday and pretend if any. Any suggestion on the order will be welcome
[10/10/23, 10:30:12 AM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: First pre reads, then Watch the lecture video if you missed the class and then read the summary from post session. Should be enough.
[10/10/23, 10:32:32 AM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: What the materials for week3
[10/10/23, 10:44:16 AM] ‪+1 (407) 530‑6612‬: Good morning all,
I felt the same this week. They jumped from an entry level content to something too much advanced. In addition, I thought that the live lectures from MIT would be provided to a smaller group just like the mentor group. It was simple insane to follow up the conversation on the chat.

I am afraid that we won’t have enough time to absorb the content and prepare for our next lecture tomorrow.

I’ve sent my feedback to GreatLearning yesterday
[10/10/23, 10:44:49 AM] ‪+1 (206) 422‑3828‬: I’m glad I wasn’t the only one that felt a bit left behind!
[10/10/23, 10:45:05 AM] ‪+1 (781) 296‑2531‬: Same here..
[10/10/23, 10:48:00 AM] ‪+1 (438) 357‑9685‬: I felt the same
[10/10/23, 10:49:33 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Agree
[10/10/23, 10:49:45 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Reported thrice by now
[10/10/23, 10:50:13 AM] Han: Same here.  But apparently, there were some people who were familiar with all these statistical concepts like Bonferroni, etc.  I tried looking up some of those terms in my statistics book, but no luck.  And the book was from a class I took just a few years ago. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/10/23, 10:50:50 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: But thats few
[10/10/23, 10:50:58 AM] ‪+1 (219) 929‑7318‬: has anyone heard an estimate of how long it will take to grade the Projects?
[10/10/23, 10:51:00 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Not even 25%
[10/10/23, 10:51:08 AM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Nope
[10/10/23, 10:55:08 AM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: I couldn’t even understand why correction needs to be done. The error correction section was the most challenging for me to follow 😔
[10/10/23, 10:57:14 AM] ‪+1 (704) 247‑0706‬: I echo you … what’s the email or other sources you used to provide your f/b? I’m a bit frustrated with program manager’s responsiveness. No timely info/communication.
[10/10/23, 10:57:58 AM] Han: I'll have to rewatch the video and try to research the various concepts she brought up.  Wonder if the next quiz/project will include any of these topics.
[10/10/23, 10:59:03 AM] ‪+506 7209 1200‬: I felt the same, I tried to understand yesterday's class but I didn't grasp anything, also, the chat doesn't help at all .. to much of everything
[10/10/23, 11:00:02 AM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: Program manager Rishika is sick out today I saw on slack. Someone else is covering for her.
[10/10/23, 11:00:50 AM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: Agree guys.. ride got little bumpy but let’s keep grinding on.  Hopefully they pace out a bit going fwd.
[10/10/23, 11:06:17 AM] ‪+1 (650) 374‑8786‬: Same last 2 lectures were blah
‎[10/10/23, 11:06:40 AM] ‪+1 (914) 610‑5891‬: ‎image omitted
[10/10/23, 11:07:51 AM] ‪+1 (650) 374‑8786‬: Yes I think rest of the weekends its supposed to be 2 mentored sessions
[10/10/23, 11:08:06 AM] ‪+1 (407) 530‑6612‬: I sent the feedback after yesterday’s lecture and I am also planning to reach to the program manager
[10/10/23, 11:08:48 AM] Han: I tried to follow the chat messages during the lecture.  But with a lot of people active in chat, it was hard to follow.  Had to scroll up and down a lot.  It got to the point where I just ignored it.
[10/10/23, 11:10:34 AM] ‪+1 (914) 610‑5891‬: I think they may have released it here. Just got an email. Havent seen it yet
The released content contains:

Post-Session Summary
Live Lecture Transcripts
Live Lecture Chat summarizing the lecture for LVC 1
[10/10/23, 11:14:18 AM] ‪+1 (914) 610‑5891‬: yeah, the chat transcript is provided, just checked it, you will need to scroll for 5mins to get past the good morning messages though 🤣
[10/10/23, 11:15:08 AM] ‪+1 (425) 358‑0423‬: I’m curious to know who controls the quiz content, projects, and capstone - is it Great Learning? And what kind of influence does MIT have on our experience outside of the weekday live lectures.
[10/10/23, 11:20:17 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: I was told this program is equivalent to a Masters by one of my friend who completed it last July
[10/10/23, 11:21:14 AM] Han: That's a very good question.  When I was researching Data Science programs, I was under the impression that MIT would be more involved since it's their name on the program and that Great Learning is just a delivery platform.  But now, it feels like Great Learning is the one doing most of the driving with MIT professors giving the weekday lectures.
[10/10/23, 11:21:17 AM] ‪+1 (407) 530‑6612‬: That’s a good point.
[10/10/23, 11:21:26 AM] ‪+1 (781) 296‑2531‬: Masters in 12 weeks???
[10/10/23, 11:21:49 AM] Han: After the first live lecture, it feels more like PhD level.
[10/10/23, 11:22:08 AM] ‪+1 (407) 530‑6612‬: It looks like a white label platform using MIT brand
[10/10/23, 11:22:12 AM] ‪+1 (914) 610‑5891‬: Steroids and booster rockets
[10/10/23, 11:22:39 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: I think most of the stuff is controlled by great learning.  MIT just does a live video session with top material. 😅

[10/10/23, 11:24:28 AM] ‪+1 (732) 762‑5126‬: Thanks
[10/10/23, 11:25:16 AM] ‪+1 (781) 296‑2531‬: So true...I was questioning myself what I signed up for 😄
[10/10/23, 11:26:53 AM] ‪+52 81 2888 9558‬: We need to ask them to push due dates on related quizz
[10/10/23, 11:27:15 AM] Han: Did anyone else notice that Quiz 1 was due after Quiz 2?
[10/10/23, 11:27:29 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: Not sure
‎[10/10/23, 11:30:59 AM] Han: ‎image omitted
[10/10/23, 11:31:53 AM] ‪+65 8303 1879‬: I think it’s due to someone join late
[10/10/23, 11:33:09 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: I think this has been customized for you, mine ended on 3rd October and the statistics quiz ended on 9th October
[10/10/23, 11:33:34 AM] Han: That's interesting.
[10/10/23, 11:33:40 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: It depends on the individual.  Mine was on Oct 9 4PM EDT for quiz2
[10/10/23, 11:34:12 AM] ‪+1 (703) 944‑1994‬: anyon ekno abotu upcomign calsses? they sent a postposned class notice with new datsa and times
[10/10/23, 11:38:28 AM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: Hey guys, we just got an announcement that some lectures are preponed to Oct 23,25 and 27. Does that mean we won’t be having revision week or?
[10/10/23, 11:38:56 AM] ‪+51 964 257 681‬: I don't think that, maybe equivalent to one course for Master's degree
[10/10/23, 11:39:44 AM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: Mine too was due Oct 3
[10/10/23, 11:44:59 AM] Han: Got the same.  They updated the course schedule on-line as well.
[10/10/23, 11:46:15 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: I will wait till the end lol
[10/10/23, 11:47:00 AM] ‪+1 (909) 362‑2376‬: I think we should ask them to postpone it instead of preponing them. Decision Tree, Random Forest are very important ML algorithms and I think most people on this group will be interested in those lectures. I don’t think it makes sense to prepone these lectures when we are struggling to keep up. If you guys agree, please send a message to your program manager.
[10/10/23, 11:47:00 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: It is not ok they change the schedule when almost everyone is a working professional and we need time to catch up
[10/10/23, 11:47:08 AM] ‪+1 (408) 687‑8705‬: I am really late since I had to travel and play catch up at work. I am still working on week1. I completed year long CTO course at Wharton early this year. My plan of action for now is focus on understanding the material and submitting assignments as per my schedule with extensions. We are working individuals burnt out is not an option.
[10/10/23, 11:47:49 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: Absolutely
[10/10/23, 11:48:14 AM] ‪+966 55 222 0130‬: Same here !
[10/10/23, 11:52:56 AM] ‪+1 (704) 247‑0706‬: Same here … frustrating part is who do we talk to with our concerns. I don’t see program manager too responsive.
[10/10/23, 11:54:55 AM] ‪+41 79 330 96 53‬: ‎‪+41 79 330 96 53‬ joined using this group's invite link
[10/10/23, 11:56:32 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: I sent a message to my program manager to stick to the original schedule
[10/10/23, 11:58:09 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: I don’t know why they think it is ok to change the schedule, my understanding was all professors time should have been precooked and we have our own schedule to follow in our work and personal life.. they can’t change the timing for 100 people cos one guy is available earlier..
[10/10/23, 12:58:51 PM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: Who grades the Project. Great Learning or MIT Professors?
[10/10/23, 1:03:32 PM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: Neither, is my guess. Questions in the project discussion forum were answered by "Evaluator". I'm guessing it's Great Learning staff
[10/10/23, 1:32:14 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: I would guess a part time postdocs or undergraduate, side job MI engenders are hired to do the grading.
[10/10/23, 1:36:46 PM] ‪+51 964 257 681‬: I would guess mentors or other Great Learning staff
[10/10/23, 1:40:14 PM] ‪+1 (909) 362‑2376‬: I also think that the mentors will be grading our project.
[10/10/23, 1:47:53 PM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: Great Learning has incentive to make money, MIT as well, but MIT because of reputation is more rigorous. So If Greatlearning Mentors are in charge they may be slightly liberal compared to MIT profs
[10/10/23, 1:48:42 PM] ‪+91 97390 32951‬: I am not sure abou this course, but when I was in stanfrod..their professors was seriously evaluating the assignments.
[10/10/23, 1:49:42 PM] ‪+1 (408) 372‑6626‬: Hi all, just saw this in my mailbox.

This is to inform you that the Live Virtual Classes with MIT Faculty for the Practical Data Science course have been preponed due to the professor’s availability. Per the updated schedule, the lectures will be held on the following dates:

LVC 1 (Decision Trees) - Oct 23rd
LVC 2 (Random Forest) - Oct 25th
LVC 3 (Time Series) - Oct 27th

The Mentored Learning Sessions for this course will be held on the weekend of Oct 28th/29th.
[10/10/23, 1:52:22 PM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: Send an email to your program manager to stick to the original schedule please.. I already did
[10/10/23, 2:00:49 PM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: How was the class yesterday: Data Analysis and Visualization class by Caroline Uhler. Did not get to watch yet. Although I got attendance to this class. I could not listen as I had work to do. When I saw, there were soo many chat messages back and forth.. I saw in between that some one said brain overload. Was it so much information ? ‎<This message was edited>
[10/10/23, 2:07:19 PM] ‪+1 (914) 610‑5891‬: I doubt the MIT profs have that much time 🙂 Looks like Great Learning is doing the admin and peripheral work. MIT is just lending its name. But every major institution has these programs as there is too much money on the table to leave (even for whartons or stanfords or MITs or Oxfords) ‎<This message was edited>
[10/10/23, 2:15:56 PM] Han: Short answer - it was a really deep dive into statistics.  It felt more like a doctoral/PhD level course.
[10/10/23, 2:17:59 PM] ‪+1 (438) 357‑9685‬: That's true, I got frustrated with lots of messages coming at a time and not able to understand  some topics.
[10/10/23, 2:20:45 PM] ‪+1 (438) 357‑9685‬: Correct,  felt like prof. Herself revising the topics LOL. It was too fast for entry level users who never gone through statistics.
[10/10/23, 2:21:22 PM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: Is this week going to be as intense like last week? Any Idea, with the quiz for "Data Analysis and Visualization" due on Oct 17
[10/10/23, 2:22:01 PM] ‪+1 (438) 357‑9685‬: This week we have live lectures and quiz to complete until 17th oct
[10/10/23, 3:14:32 PM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: Maybe we can plan a short revision session for this weeks course so that we’re better prepped for the coming quiz (if no one has attempted it yet)
[10/10/23, 3:14:42 PM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: On a zoom call
[10/10/23, 3:15:17 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: I am in.
[10/10/23, 3:17:44 PM] ‪+51 964 257 681‬: Agree
[10/10/23, 3:22:03 PM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: I love the idea 💡
[10/10/23, 3:23:19 PM] ‪+1 (408) 372‑6626‬: +1 to having additional study sessions. Personally, I started looking for youtube videos for various statistics concepts. This is starting to pay off. If any of you find relevant videos maybe we can share them with each other?
[10/10/23, 3:28:00 PM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: Can we please push back on advancing the schedule for the Practical Data science course?
[10/10/23, 3:28:09 PM] ‪+1 (407) 530‑6612‬: I am wondering if you guys have completed the optional videos from W2… I haven’t had a chance to watch, but my best experience so far was with the optional content from W1
[10/10/23, 3:57:07 PM] ‪+1 (438) 357‑9685‬: Good idea but who is gonna assist us ?? 🤔
[10/10/23, 3:58:23 PM] ‪+1 (438) 357‑9685‬: That would be good
[10/10/23, 4:17:22 PM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: I did and it was helpful to understand various hypotheses testing options available in Python

[10/10/23, 4:28:56 PM] ‪+1 (407) 530‑6612‬: The W1 optional content covers several practical scenarios of EDA. Highly recommended.

[10/10/23, 5:06:07 PM] ‪+51 964 257 681‬: When? Any suggestions?
[10/10/23, 5:06:22 PM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: Should we aim for Thursday?
[10/10/23, 5:06:29 PM] ‪+52 55 9110 5256‬: No yet but I will do later. Still mentally tired from yesterday
[10/10/23, 5:06:31 PM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: Given that we’re done lectures for the week
[10/10/23, 5:36:14 PM] ‪+1 (425) 358‑0423‬: We still have lecture Wednesday and Thursday. Or are you referring to Thursday after lecture is complete?
[10/10/23, 5:36:54 PM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: Yes Thurs after lecture is completed
[10/10/23, 7:14:06 PM] ‪+1 (437) 288‑3670‬: I watched a testimony of the course from the (I believe) President of the Bank of America about this program. Now, the only thing I can think of is that the ONLY way he was able to complete this program is if he literally ABANDONED the bank for 4 months, otherwise that's not possible 😂
[10/10/23, 7:50:29 PM] ‪+1 (703) 944‑1994‬: Too funny! I agree as it's a lot of work which forced you to stay up until 2 or 3 am and then have to work a full day. Or, just cram and pray for the best:)
[10/10/23, 7:52:24 PM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: I can totally see that :)

[10/10/23, 8:13:40 PM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: Does anybody know what kind of roles can you get after completing this course?
[10/10/23, 8:18:58 PM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: were you referring to feedback from this guy??? in the end in our introductory class ?: https://www.linkedin.com/in/laxmi-narayana-byagari-54aa568/ ‎<This message was edited>
[10/10/23, 8:22:23 PM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: Couple of points he said was : the first 2 to 3 weeks were overwhelming of information. If you crossed 2 weeks, then hang in there, you will make it.
[10/10/23, 8:24:08 PM] ‪+1 (732) 762‑5126‬: I believe this is the guy who was invited to our introductory session, he is VicePresident at BOA

[10/10/23, 8:34:12 PM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: Under courses look for 'Data Analysis & Visualization' an within that you should see Live Virtual Class 2 Network Analysis, expand that for what they are going to cover tomorrow

[10/10/23, 8:47:07 PM] ‪+1 (732) 762‑5126‬: I have a basic question if anyone knows, all the quizzes and projects do we need atleast 60% in order to get the certificate? Does this include the final capstone project? Or is this certificate dependent only on capstone project?
[10/10/23, 8:55:41 PM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: It's 60% in each of the "courses". I don't know how the capstone figures into that. Maybe 60% on that too
[10/10/23, 10:07:47 PM] ‪+1 (914) 610‑5891‬: He is not the president but a VP at BoA. In banks, VP is a common title as you all know.
[10/10/23, 10:59:02 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: True that.  Banks have inflated titles.  I am a VP myself in Bank of America,  but functionally an engineering manager who runs team for surveillance on trading activities.  Titles don’t mean much, never get flattered.

[10/10/23, 11:40:04 PM] ‪+1 (408) 372‑6626‬: Yup. If you think about it - our class on Monday worked as a wake up call and the type of commitment they really expect from all of us. It's definitely not 10-15 hours per week as advertised 😀 ‎<This message was edited>

[10/11/23, 12:04:15 AM] ‪+1 (408) 372‑6626‬: I spoke to a few people. The alternative would be to join in a Masters program, or some sort of 1 year program. These are lot more expensive and take lot more time and commitment. 

Agree that it takes a lot of personal commitment to get successful in this program, and it's hard to do while we all have a full-time job but I am definitely looking forward to claim this course on LinkedIn along with the rest of my experience to add some credibility. How much can certainly vary. 

Maybe we ought to find the right capstone project to add more value. Let's keep thinking about the right project maybe from now... ‎<This message was edited>
[10/11/23, 12:05:41 AM] ‪+1 (704) 962‑4113‬: Imho there are a lot of other ai, data science programs available from various sources.
I have multiple Microsoft certifications including a MCSE, MCSA and Trainer which helper open doors for new jobs.

For me, this class im learning a lot, its hard and when done I'll get to add Applied data science from MIT on resume.
I like to believe there is WOW factor of a pedigree university is worth it.
Just my 2 cents.

Its a journey....

[10/11/23, 1:12:31 AM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: I dont think we are supposed to pull them here,  they would only communicate via Slack or email.  Beside i this watsapp is bit informal for us to vent out as well time to time.. ;).

Also, for tomorrow's session, it would help to read the introductory Graph Theory; the slides that are going to be presented are not so clear from my perspective.

[10/11/23, 4:51:09 PM] ‪+507 6840‑0045‬: Hello, please can you help me with this doubt:

Why is the Hi > 40, instead of Hi < 40 in the following example case??  I was doing it by myself and I defined it the other way, and I don´t understand

A certain food aggregator ZYX is facing stiff competition from its main rival SWG during the Corona period. To retain business, ZYX is advertising that, within a radius of 5 km from the restaurant where the order is placed, it can still deliver in 40 minutes or less (and the changed condition has not made any impact on them).

The delivery times in minutes of 25 randomly selected deliveries are given in a CSV file.

Assuming the delivery distribution is approximately normal, is there enough evidence that ZYX’s claim is false?
[10/11/23, 4:52:50 PM] ‪+507 6840‑0045‬: I defined: 

H0 = 40,   Hi < 40, 

But it seems my approach is not correct
[10/11/23, 4:55:52 PM] ‪+1 (408) 908‑0220‬: Hi > 40 because Ho <=40
[10/11/23, 4:56:48 PM] ‪+1 (408) 908‑0220‬: The claim of ZYX is <=40
[10/11/23, 4:57:39 PM] ‪+971 56 805 9103‬: Null hypothesis should be less than 40 and the alternate hypothesis should be above 40 

The business is claiming that it can deliver food in 40 mins or less which means that is your first or null hypothesis! We always have to accept or reject the null hypothesis and in this case the alternate hypothesis (acceptance or rejection of the null) is above 40. Hence h0 <=40 and h1 >40
[10/11/23, 4:58:37 PM] ‪+971 56 805 9103‬: That’s what they said as far as I remember

Dr. Uhler’s answer (during the session): Yes, it is possible
Their answer: In our experience, this does not happen and hence no they do not co-exist:

[10/12/23, 7:26:05 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Uh, I have asked the same... but I don't recall Dr. Uhler answering it... I mean, I believe you... and I was paying attention, but I am afraid I did not listen to her answer.
[10/12/23, 7:47:07 AM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: Oh you could have easily missed it, I would have too, it was just a passing comment as she checked the chat and was summarizing the different types of graphs…. And then a casual comment - “and we can have directed and undirected graphs together”. She did not elaborate that they are called mixed graphs. I think that’s the reason Ankit and Niruppam missed it as well - if they were listening. I wish I had the transcript, it’s not uploaded in mine.
[10/12/23, 7:50:11 AM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: I am still struggling understanding eigenvector centrality, if anyone can help me with a good resource/video, really appreciate it. 🙏🏼
[10/12/23, 8:11:46 AM] ‪+44 7981 981564‬: The core idea behind eigenvector centrality is that a node is important if it allows to propagate across the network, i.e. if it is connected to nodes (neighbours) that have a high level of centrality. So it's not only about how many connections the node has, but also about how many connections its NEIGHBOURS have

This is quite good
[10/12/23, 8:17:51 AM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: Thank you Michael, I understand that’s the purpose, but how does eigenvector come into picture. Aren’t eigenvectors used to reduce dimensionality - in other words- represent high dimensional data in lower dimensions without much loss of information/variance. How does this transformation play a role in the centrality calculation is what I am looking for. 

Will check the link to figure out if this makes better sense for me. Once again thanks Michael.

[10/12/23, 8:21:23 AM] ‪+44 7981 981564‬: that's the key in the calculation
[10/12/23, 8:21:49 AM] ‪+44 7981 981564‬: the calculation of the centrality involves finding eigenvectors
[10/12/23, 8:23:44 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: This is what I was asking yday but I think the mentors kinda brushed past the answer. The eigenvectors of a matrix (can be covariance matrix or adjacent matrix) are used to highlight the important nodes of a matrix. If you think intuitively an eigenvector doesn’t change its directly after being linearly transformed so it must contain some information about the transformer being applied to it. So eigenvector of covariance matrix gives us info about largest variance directions and eigenvectors of adjacent matrix gives is info of most adjacent (influential) nodes. @17346358370
[10/12/23, 8:51:18 AM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: Oh thank you Michael and Shilpa. Both of your responses helped me understand it. Now it makes sense. Thank you so much
[10/12/23, 8:53:04 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Guys, any good material on Gaussian Mixture Models?
[10/12/23, 8:53:51 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: BTW, has anyone tried the practice quiz for W3?
[10/12/23, 9:05:13 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Guys... general question, I'd appreciate if anyone has any insight... what is the use in Agglomerative Clustering, of ending up with a one single cluster containing all the datapoints? and likewise, in Divisive Clustering, to end up having a number of clusters equal to the number of data points?   Do you mandatorily need to end up in any of these states or can this algorithm stop in an "intermediate" clustering point?
[10/12/23, 9:06:07 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: I mean, if the purpose is to create clusters... not clear to me why you end up with an "include it all" cluster, or to end up with separate individual datapoints.
[10/12/23, 9:07:31 AM] ‪+44 7981 981564‬: My guess is it gives you a range of N clusters, then it's up to you to decide how many you want (which is also the case with K-means, you decide in advance how many clusters you want to see)
[10/12/23, 9:08:20 AM] ‪+44 7981 981564‬: the method just illustrates how you end up producing N clusters
[10/12/23, 9:09:00 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: I see!  somehow like an "auxiliary" algorithm?  to set your own range?
[10/12/23, 9:09:30 AM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: I think it might be used to determine the ELBOW.
[10/12/23, 9:09:38 AM] ‪+44 7981 981564‬: it's just the process by which you build the clusters
[10/12/23, 10:26:01 AM] ‪+1 (437) 973‑9491‬: Folks - For all sessions this week, what do you recommend for studying or way to study them. I am still lost at sea, so would like to go through something which can make me understand these concepts.
[10/12/23, 10:26:32 AM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: +1
[10/12/23, 10:26:52 AM] ‪+966 55 222 0130‬: The question is , how are we examined on these concepts? 

We are learning the applied part right?
[10/12/23, 10:27:34 AM] ‪+966 55 222 0130‬: You can learn this forever, no point if you don’t really apply them in a case study.
[10/12/23, 10:28:12 AM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: The issue now I’m attending the lecture and I am really lost
[10/12/23, 10:28:43 AM] ‪+971 58 953 6461‬: Practical questions are dodged here!
[10/12/23, 10:29:30 AM] ‪+971 58 953 6461‬: Does anyone have idea on how to convert the transactional data in dimensional data that can be used as input without losing patters?
[10/12/23, 10:29:32 AM] ‪+1 (781) 296‑2531‬: I hope weekend Mentored learning puts these in a case study so it will be clear.
[10/12/23, 10:30:23 AM] ‪+971 58 953 6461‬: The case studies generally start with ready for input dataset.. in real life you don’t get served with such dataset on a platter! 🥲
[10/12/23, 10:30:26 AM] ‪+1 (781) 296‑2531‬: Right now it feels like listening to Sheldon from Big bang theory 😄
[10/12/23, 10:35:23 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Two questions:
1)  What is the mentored session on weekend going to be about?
2)  Has anyone tried the Week 3 practice quiz?
[10/12/23, 10:35:34 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Maybe that would give us a good hint of how this is going to be tested.
[10/12/23, 10:36:18 AM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: I am in my company meeting and attending this session. It is very challenging but I am up for the challenge to learn sometime this week. We are trying to learn lot of concepts in one day. Be patient and May be we can connect as a group smaller cohort in a call and discuss to learn what was taught by exchanging notes. My 2 cents to catchup with this uphill learning battle
[10/12/23, 10:37:36 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: I am a deaf for this meeeting. but watching as i am in another meeting.
[10/12/23, 10:37:36 AM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: Im always a week behind but once catching up everything seems easy. I think we need a week off to catch up as the rate is very fast
[10/12/23, 10:37:46 AM] ‪+966 55 222 0130‬: K-means and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are both popular algorithms used for clustering data, but they have some fundamental differences.

K-means is a simple and widely used clustering algorithm. It aims to partition a dataset into K clusters, where K is a predetermined number specified by the user. The algorithm iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest cluster center and updates the cluster centers based on the mean of the assigned points. This process continues until the cluster assignments no longer change significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached. K-means assumes that each data point belongs to exactly one cluster and that the clusters are spherical and have equal variance.

On the other hand, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is a probabilistic model that represents the data as a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Instead of assuming that each data point belongs to a single cluster, GMM allows for the possibility that a data point can belong to multiple clusters with different probabilities. Each cluster in a GMM is modeled as a Gaussian distribution, characterized by its mean and covariance matrix. The model learns these parameters by fitting the data through an iterative algorithm called the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.

In summary, the main differences between K-means and Gaussian mixture models are:

1. Cluster Assignment: K-means assigns each data point to a single cluster, while GMM assigns probabilities of belonging to multiple clusters.
2. Cluster Shape: K-means assumes that clusters are spherical and have equal variance, while GMM can model clusters with different shapes and variances by using Gaussian distributions.
3. Flexibility: GMM offers more flexibility in representing complex data distributions by allowing overlapping clusters and accommodating varying cluster shapes.
4. Probabilistic Representation: GMM provides a probabilistic representation of the data, allowing for uncertainty in cluster assignments.

It's important to note that the choice between K-means and GMM depends on the characteristics of your data and the goals of your analysis.

[10/12/23, 12:01:01 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Anyone here is feeling like this is easy and not felling overwhelming? If so, please tell me were you learn the necessary content to fell that way 😭
[10/12/23, 12:01:19 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: If you plot this threads post counts with the test assessment results it would be a interesting data 😆
[10/12/23, 12:01:24 PM] ‪+52 844 106 9579‬: I feel you
[10/12/23, 12:01:40 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: They said the course picks up FAST
[10/12/23, 12:01:49 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Can only expect going downhill from here
[10/12/23, 12:04:09 PM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: Sophia. Try reading the summaries post session because they are very insightful and clearer. Lecture presentations really don’t help much.
[10/12/23, 12:04:44 PM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: I’d like to know as well! I think I’ll attempt this right now
[10/12/23, 12:05:20 PM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: Don't tempt me! Just need to export the data... Message volume in x minute intervals from 3 hours before until 3 hours after, for each lecture day. And see how that trends by week (professor). Would that be a measure of quality?
[10/12/23, 12:06:00 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Does anyone remember the "Python championship" quizzes thing? They said there will be badges and so on

[10/12/23, 12:07:11 PM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: I asked them and they had said would be available within a week. No news as yet!
[10/12/23, 12:07:19 PM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: I been asking this from moment they reschedule the classes.. please send an email to the program manager

[10/12/23, 12:07:35 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: They said only top 5 will get, what if 6 people got a full mark?
[10/12/23, 12:08:10 PM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: Yeh, may be we should check with the program manager
[10/12/23, 12:08:34 PM] ‪+1 (703) 309‑3099‬: I highly recommend the guided version of the project - but follow through cell by cell and build the code as you go (at least through the first few methods until you understand the patterns.

[10/12/23, 12:12:03 PM] ‪+1 (703) 309‑3099‬: Best practice is a regular session to go through it all and plan out the next days
[10/12/23, 12:12:30 PM] ‪+507 6840‑0045‬: Reading the post-sessions helps a lot...it takes a lot of time to really Catch the content but worth it.  

In my case, it is very demanding to understand what is going on...half of the class I barely understand what the professor is saying 🤦🏻‍♂️
[10/12/23, 12:13:28 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: The thing is there’s no enough time, really need that week to catch up
[10/12/23, 12:16:06 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: The practice quiz isn't that hard, 10 questions, 3 questions from each class, (today's has 4)
[10/12/23, 12:16:46 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: So if you have solid understanding of all classes, should be easy
[10/12/23, 12:17:29 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: If you lost focus in one class, 70% isn't half bad (still 25% chance of randomly getting a question right)
[10/12/23, 12:18:27 PM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: Confidence level is very low😂
[10/12/23, 12:19:45 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: I didn't pay a single minute of attention in first lecture, was doing the project during, so every time she said PCA I had no idea what she's saying
[10/12/23, 12:21:29 PM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: I muted my classes and was working, so the next few days are gonna be intense
[10/12/23, 12:23:03 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Rewatching everything in the weekend is your only hope
[10/12/23, 12:23:10 PM] ‪+1 (704) 247‑0706‬: Super helpful!!!!! Thank you!
[10/12/23, 12:23:35 PM] ‪+1 (704) 247‑0706‬: Will go throu recordings and pre-reads!
[10/12/23, 12:23:49 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Good thing is we can just use google in exams
[10/12/23, 12:24:16 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: So a full mark is not an issue, the issue is actually understanding
[10/12/23, 12:24:19 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: But there are group lectures 😭
[10/12/23, 12:24:30 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Oh yeah, forgot about those
[10/12/23, 12:24:49 PM] ‪+1 (469) 243‑8471‬: Same here 😅 Everything we’re learning is completely new for me and I feel so behind. Any advice for someone coming in out of this field would be very appreciated 😭
[10/12/23, 12:25:22 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Heard about Einstein's theory of General relativity? If you travel to a speed closer to the speed of light, time slows down, and you'll have enough time to actually finish the requirements for the course
[10/12/23, 12:25:42 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Feeling the same, it doesn’t matter if I don’t get the diploma I just want to get the best of the course
[10/12/23, 12:26:30 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: You sure it doesn't matter if you don't get it? All that money would be gone with no paper 💀

[10/12/23, 12:28:02 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Fear is the capstone project, if things continued on this pace, will be public humiliation
[10/12/23, 12:30:06 PM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: Live this week, when it comes to that bridge, you will cross it 😀
[10/12/23, 12:30:10 PM] ‪+966 55 222 0130‬: What are the conditions of getting the diploma?
[10/12/23, 12:30:33 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Minimum 60% in every course
[10/12/23, 12:30:43 PM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: I think it is the case for a lot of folks, read all the pretext in the course content, will make the lectures easier to understand.
[10/12/23, 12:30:49 PM] ‪+1 (704) 247‑0706‬: 60% and above in each course and attendance score is 60% and above
[10/12/23, 12:30:55 PM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: Bee very very Coool, Calm!. Close your eyes and take a Deep breath

[10/12/23, 12:33:26 PM] ‪+49 176 23224829‬: Maybe it helps if you think about how to implement all the current knowledge into your daily work. Exercising and playing around a bit also helps….
[10/12/23, 12:33:37 PM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: It is shouldn’t be that hard for you 😅
[10/12/23, 12:39:00 PM] ‪+507 6840‑0045‬: Just that is the problem though...I haven´t understand the classes 😫
[10/12/23, 12:42:09 PM] ‪+971 58 953 6461‬: This course standalone won’t help with that. We need a lot of peripheral research.  The assumption is you’re just dealing with data science and need no other skill/intuition relating to data pre-processing/engineering as this would be someone else’s responsibility.

[10/12/23, 5:32:16 PM] ‪+971 58 953 6461‬: So we’ve got to 1- learn all the python coding by ourselves and 2- also do additional research on the peripheral concepts while we’re giving SOME intuitions on how the models work. This is my understanding. Any clarifications? 🥶

[10/12/23, 10:09:01 PM] ‪+1 (408) 908‑0220‬: Just took the week 3 quiz. Very different from the practice quiz.  Study corrections for multiple testing, PCA, t-SNE, DBSAN, different types of linkage for hierarchical clustering,  there are things from every lecture.

[10/13/23, 7:50:43 AM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: First 2 weeks it was one weekend mentor session. For the rest of the time it's two. Makes sense with the difference in difficulty of content.
[10/13/23, 7:52:59 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: As long as the weekend classes are just reviews and not new material
[10/13/23, 7:54:24 AM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: Well.... my take is that it's review, but in the context of applying it and Python code. Shouldn't be new concepts.
[10/13/23, 7:57:21 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: As long as we understand the theory, Stackoverflow takes care of the coding 👌

[10/13/23, 8:17:50 AM] ‪+52 844 106 9579‬: Thanks 😊

[10/13/23, 8:23:16 AM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: I think she is talking about Bonferroni and Holm corrections for FWER and Benjamini-Hochberg for FDR
[10/13/23, 8:24:01 AM] ‪+966 55 890 0805‬: Thanks Varuni for the clarification . It makes sense
[10/13/23, 8:24:03 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: I'm not a big fan of AI help, they're good at giving suggestions max, but if something has a "right or wrong" answer, they're pretty useless
[10/13/23, 8:51:05 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Idk tho ^ GitHub copilot is super good at near correct code generation! It hallucinates sometime but overall quality is really good
[10/13/23, 9:08:03 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Finished quiz 3 as well. I think it was pretty representative of all the lectures. I wouldn’t stress too much about it. Found it more easy (less ambiguous) than the practice quiz.
[10/13/23, 9:09:27 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: GitHub copilot is made specifically for that purpose, same with Wolfram Alpha for math, but ChatGPT and Bart and so on, not the best at it
[10/13/23, 9:10:27 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: If you asked them what's 1+1 they'd say 2, if you said no it's 3 they'd say oh yeah you're right
[10/13/23, 9:11:09 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: You’re right as in it’s not trained for logic but chatgpt is also trained on public repos and stackoverflow
[10/13/23, 9:11:53 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: So if I asked it to help me with my code, it'll say "this question has already been answered before"? 💀
[10/13/23, 9:13:16 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Lol no it’ll answer usually pretty correctly with what it thinks is the right piece of code. I’ve found it pretty accurate and close to copilot
[10/13/23, 9:14:36 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: I was more highlighting AI not equal to LLM because the talk was about using AI to code for AI! But I’m stilll pro chatgpt for code ♥️
[10/13/23, 9:14:46 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Great then, that's my projects done for the course
[10/13/23, 9:16:06 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: They sent an email scheduling online class for next week.. seems like they don’t care about anyone else’s schedule

[10/13/23, 10:33:50 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: But if we struggle with week 3, how can we expect to become data scientists
[10/13/23, 10:34:39 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Yep :) The questions were different from the practice quiz but in my opinion more straightforward. If you study all the lecture material and understand the high level intuition that’s good enough!
[10/13/23, 10:35:31 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Test corrections, pca, tsne, centralities and clustering
[10/13/23, 10:36:07 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Excellent.  Thanks, you really brought lot of tranquility to my mind....
[10/13/23, 10:38:38 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Guys... can someone send again the link to join people into the group?  I would like to add someone (or share the link) from another similar WhatsApp group we have like this, but from LATAM.
[10/13/23, 10:40:01 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Okayyyy betweenness centrality 😂
[10/13/23, 10:40:59 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: in my personal case I am not expecting to become a data scientist, tbh, but at least to have a better insight of AI and ML (which I know at the moment at user level only), the work market is moving towards that direction, regardless of the business area you are involved on.
[10/13/23, 10:43:09 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: I'm not trying to sound rude or anything, just a doubt, don't take it the wrong way, but if your purpose is just to get a better insight, why not just watch some YouTube videos or free courses, instead of paying a large amount for this one
[10/13/23, 10:43:22 AM] ‪+1 (438) 357‑9685‬: Yes this is really nice
[10/13/23, 10:47:32 AM] ‪+44 7956 214078‬: Same here
[10/13/23, 10:49:40 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: No worries, I don't take it like that 😉 .  Answering your question, I do this for two reasons:  a course certified and vouched by the MIT on my Resume definitely looks way better than writing in my resume than a "studied in YouTube" entry 🤣.    I have a 5-year old daughter and one more on the way.   Having something like this in my Resume (and the knowledge, but of course) is partially like an "employment insurance" (in case I become unemployed, this gives me much better chances to secure another job, I have children to support).  The second reason, like they were saying yesterday in this chat, SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME FIRE under your feet 🔥🦶🏻  to move .
[10/13/23, 10:51:38 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: So it's not only for "getting a better insight", makes more sense, hopefully all ends up good
[10/13/23, 10:52:09 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: I don’t think everyone wants to become a data scientist, it is more of understanding and having a holistic view of how data can be used in an organization
[10/13/23, 10:52:10 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Or we can just make our own data science startup, +100 future data scientists already 🧐
[10/13/23, 10:52:24 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Yeah true
[10/13/23, 10:54:33 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Well... I was not expecting having to give an extended and comprehensive answer....  🤣.  That was my short answer.
[10/13/23, 10:55:14 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: Unless you have a few oil wells 🤣
[10/13/23, 10:57:04 AM] ‪+1 (425) 358‑0423‬: hey yall, I just had a call with Prashi to ask some questions, and am sharing them with you in case you have the same questions. ---- I asked about what level of retention are we expected to have in order to succeed in this course - she said we are learning a lot so we do not need to worry about memorizing everything at this time. We will have access to our curriculum for 3 years and will be able to dive in deeper after the course is over. in the meantime for the assignments and quizzes, it is expected that we may be referencing notes. ----- I mentioned that one of my mentors stated they did not know what we were covering during the week and wasn't able to speak on it when we had questions during a weekend call - she said all mentors were given our course curriculum and should know what we are learning every week. ----- I asked about the capstone and if we could have notice on what we will be asked to do so that we can best prepare - she said that it will be shared with us ahead of time so that we can prepare before we start. They don't want to share it now so that we don't get overwhelmed.
[10/13/23, 10:58:52 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Well, I do live in UAE 🙃 that's halfway there

[10/13/23, 12:09:19 PM] Han: @14089080220. Thanks for sharing and giving us a heads up.

Why would they make the practice quiz different from the actual quiz?  Shouldn’t the practice quiz reflect what to expect on the actual quiz?  Isn’t that the whole point of “practice” quizzes?

GL needs to get their act together. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/13/23, 5:55:47 PM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Thanks so much Mayda! 

2 small corrections in the notes (literally my fault) lowest p value = strictest correction = (a/m) in Holm Bonferroni.
[10/13/23, 5:56:12 PM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: PCA: (x and y axis data doesn’t vary much, but with z axis does, they dismiss the z-axis) should be "x and y axis data varies the most, but with z axis data doesn't vary, they dismiss the z-axis"
[10/13/23, 5:57:18 PM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: Thank you for catching that! I had to type pretty fast hahaha

[10/13/23, 6:02:33 PM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: no worries
[10/13/23, 6:03:04 PM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: Is k-mediods the same as partitioning around mediods?
[10/13/23, 6:04:49 PM] ‪+1 (732) 762‑5126‬: Many thanks for this. Sorry I was not able to attend but this would help
[10/13/23, 6:11:36 PM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: For class purposes I think they use them interchangeably but I found this which was a better way to look at both https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/141165/difference-between-k-medoids-and-pam

[10/13/23, 6:22:56 PM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: I missed it and sure I would like to be part of zoom if anyone is meeting later today
[10/13/23, 6:31:45 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Maybe you know this one guys, I have asked this during the session but got no answer:  when using medioids...when you come to the point that the medioid gets recalculated, should you move to another ACTUAL datapoint, or can the recalculation be this time moving to a centroid instead, and only using medioids as "point of departure"?
[10/13/23, 6:32:38 PM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: I believe actual data points, because the end result is the center is a real data point
[10/13/23, 6:33:15 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: thx a lot!

[10/14/23, 8:47:10 AM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: Q: t-sne uses t-distribution for clustering and overlaps many clusters to reduce dimensions and visualize. GMM uses overlapping of many Gaussian distributions to create clusters. Aren’t these two very similar to each other? How are they different other than using different distribution models?
[10/14/23, 9:15:55 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: It looks like t-SNE uses t-distribution but the original SNE uses gaussian distribution.
[10/14/23, 9:16:29 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10301.pdf
[10/14/23, 9:20:39 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: 1. T distribution is used and tsne creates 1 pdf that is similar to the pdf in the higher dimension. It’s not a clustering algorithm in the sense that if you add another point to the data, tsne would have to construct a new pdf and remap all the points. This is a visual representation of how the current data is similar represented in a lower dimension. 

2.  GMM constructs a Gaussian for k clusters. This means each cluster has a Gaussian. This is a clustering algorithm as in when you add a new point to the data set, GMM can add it to the existing Gaussians depending on the points probability in each of the k gaussians.
[10/14/23, 9:32:20 AM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Yes I agree
[10/14/23, 9:36:15 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Does anyone have something that explains nicely the "perplexity value"?
[10/14/23, 9:42:32 AM] ‪+1 (650) 374‑8786‬: Were there python questions in quiz 3?
[10/14/23, 9:43:23 AM] ‪+971 58 953 6461‬: no, mainly conceptual as I remember.. didn't need to open a jupyter/colab notebook.
[10/14/23, 9:44:27 AM] ‪+1 (650) 374‑8786‬: Thanks, as there are so many notebook in the course which Uhler didnt explain
[10/14/23, 9:45:45 AM] ‪+971 58 953 6461‬: They're part of mentored sessions and guided projects... one or two are for self paced practice..
[10/14/23, 9:46:19 AM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Is anyone in the mentored session now?
[10/14/23, 9:46:38 AM] ‪+1 (408) 908‑0220‬: Yes
[10/14/23, 9:47:16 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: It is an inbuilt Python feature that shows correct value at which the groups of components are clearly seperate. you choose the correct value based on what you are comfortable and think you would get the correct analysis. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/14/23, 9:49:09 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: For whoever took the quiz:
- Is there any question regarding the perplexity value?
- What type of question(s)  is/are there regarding measures of centrality types?
[10/14/23, 9:50:35 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Thanks @17036670734
[10/14/23, 9:51:19 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: These are the differnt types of centralities: Degree Centrality:

Degree centrality is a simple measure based on the number of edges (links) a node has. Nodes with a higher degree are considered more central.
Betweenness Centrality:

Betweenness centrality quantifies the extent to which a node lies on the shortest paths between other nodes in the network. Nodes with high betweenness centrality are important for maintaining network connectivity.
Closeness Centrality:

Closeness centrality measures how quickly a node can reach all other nodes in the network. Nodes with a shorter average distance to other nodes have higher closeness centrality.
Eigenvector Centrality:

Eigenvector centrality considers both the number of connections a node has and the centrality of the nodes to which it is connected. Nodes connected to other highly central nodes receive a higher eigenvector centrality score.
PageRank:

PageRank, originally developed by Google, is a variant of eigenvector centrality. It measures the importance of a node in a network by considering the importance of nodes linking to it. It's commonly used for web page ranking.
Katz Centrality:

Katz centrality measures a node's centrality by considering the number of paths of different lengths that pass through the node. It gives more weight to shorter paths.
Harmonic Centrality:

Harmonic centrality is based on the harmonic mean of the distances between a node and all other nodes in the network. It assigns higher centrality to nodes that are closer to many others.
Information Centrality:

Information centrality measures the influence of a node in terms of information flow in a network. It considers the paths and flow of information in the network.
Bonacich Centrality:

Bonacich centrality is a generalization of eigenvector centrality that incorporates a parameter (alpha) to control the influence of node degrees. It can identify nodes with indirect influence.
Radiality Centrality:

Radiality centrality considers the number of geodesic paths that pass through a node, emphasizing its role as a bridge in the network.
Percolation Centrality:
Percolation centrality measures a node's importance based on the resilience of the network. It quantifies how much a node contributes to network connectivity when nodes are removed at random.
[10/14/23, 9:52:03 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: How ever fo the sake of Quiz they will ask top 4, please correct me Han since you took the quiz
[10/14/23, 9:52:34 AM] Han: 1) Yes, but it’s.a general question and does not require any computation.
2) Yes, there are questions about centrality types.

Generally speaking, the questions are about knowledge and none require computations or Python coding.
[10/14/23, 9:52:36 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: You mean, the top 4 of this list?
[10/14/23, 9:57:29 AM] Han: Yes.  Just know what the different centrality measures are (top 4 are enough) and know which ones to use in different scenarios.  As an example, the question will ask: based on scenario X, which of the following is the right centrality to use … or something like that.
[10/14/23, 10:03:19 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Isn't it after 3 hours?

But I got lost sometimes when the chat was mixed with study questions and social chats. And I think it’s both important that we engage with our study and also the social networking (or providing emotional support to each other when needed 😜). That’s why I made another group for anything that’s NOT related to study topics, and hopefully this group can be cleaner for searching the important/useful information/discussion. Feel free to join

[10/14/23, 12:45:35 PM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: From my understanding, in lower dimensions, the distributions created are comparable to each other and hence to describe similarity or variance becomes difficult in direct terms. Hence informational theory tools such as KL is used which uses derivatives - which means it gives relative divergence - logarithmic difference between the probabilities weighted by first distribution.

[10/14/23, 4:44:00 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: I thought PCA reduces variable meaning deletes columns that has less effect on the data but that was not the case🤣
[10/14/23, 4:44:21 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: You sure? My understanding is the same
[10/14/23, 4:44:33 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Sees the columns with least spreading and gets rid of them
[10/14/23, 4:44:44 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Or selectively picks the columns with most spreading
[10/14/23, 4:49:12 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: If you see the mentor session jupyter notebook code "pc1 = pd.DataFrame"  it still has all the variables.  They make a new axis out of the all the variables with weights.  No one is weighed 0 so they are not getting ride of it.  It makes PC(new axis) by mixing all the variables.  I thought it will reduce the variables itself but it was not the case. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/14/23, 4:51:38 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Perhaps when it scatters the datapoints in the n-dimensional plane, creates diagonal vectors (PCs) between features, and picks the ones with highest variance? ‎<This message was edited>
[10/14/23, 4:52:27 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: So ends up getting rid of dummy vectors rather than actual features
[10/14/23, 4:52:59 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: And the vectors would need to be 90° from one another to properly map into the lower dimensional plane ‎<This message was edited>
[10/14/23, 4:53:56 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: Thinking 90° is hard to understand ... only easy to understand when it is up to 3 demention.
[10/14/23, 4:54:54 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: (may not be correct, just my intuition) think we have two vectors perpendicular to each other, we can take it as a two dimensional plane
[10/14/23, 4:55:17 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: If they were n° where n≠90, it would be difficult to map them
[10/14/23, 4:57:11 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: So technically we would be plotting the points into a vector space, and picking the vectors with the best spread, and using them as our new dimensions
[10/14/23, 4:58:31 PM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: Google Page Rank Algorithm was based on Eigen Vector Value centrality.  EigenVector Centrally number is computed based on the Adjacency matrix.
[10/14/23, 4:59:22 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: So plotting only works until 3D.  So thinking accurately 90° means calculation of matrixes of someway right?
[10/14/23, 4:59:37 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Why only until 3d?
[10/14/23, 5:00:30 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Just saying again, I'm trying to build the intuition and understanding as I go, I have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about, it could be all wrong
[10/14/23, 5:00:41 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: How do you plot on 4D can you show the plot?
[10/14/23, 5:01:18 PM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: 4D is x,y and Z plus the colored groups
[10/14/23, 5:01:23 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: You don't need to "show it", consider the plot just a way for you to see, the code doesn't need to see, just needs the data
[10/14/23, 5:01:25 PM] ‪+52 81 2888 9558‬: You could use color
[10/14/23, 5:01:31 PM] ‪+52 81 2888 9558‬: But no more than that
[10/14/23, 5:01:48 PM] ‪+52 81 2888 9558‬: And is not intuitive
[10/14/23, 5:01:57 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Plus we can use many things to represent more dimensions, colour (2nd matrix), size, transparency, shading, and more
[10/14/23, 5:02:20 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Sometimes we even use time as a dimension, think GIFs
[10/14/23, 5:02:39 PM] ‪+52 81 2888 9558‬: I think the problem it just make it to dificult to digest
[10/14/23, 5:02:44 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: So technically speaking, we can plot +10d dimensional plots
[10/14/23, 5:02:49 PM] ‪+52 81 2888 9558‬: You want plots to be easy to understand
[10/14/23, 5:03:06 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Yeah, hence why we don't need to, the code will do it's thing
[10/14/23, 5:04:25 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Or you can even use a whole different space to represent dimensions, think contour plots
[10/14/23, 5:04:37 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: So there is a limitation.  Colors don't represent 90° ... It's hard to imagine.
[10/14/23, 5:04:53 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: It's hard to imagine, but it exists
[10/14/23, 5:05:05 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: There is a 90° in every dimension
[10/14/23, 5:05:43 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Actually I think numberphile made a video about 4d 90° lemme see if I can find it

[10/14/23, 5:14:12 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: It's not actual 4 dimensional 90° lines, but the 3d representation of it
[10/14/23, 5:14:22 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: The 4th one would pop into the 4th dimension
[10/14/23, 5:14:37 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: It is hard to imagine 90 degree in every dimension like 28 for airpolution_data,  but if the calculation underneath is Va = (a1, a2, a3, a4) and Vb = (b1, b2, b3, b4) the 90 degree would be (a1 x b1) + (a2 x b2) + (a3 x b3) + (a4 x b4) = 0 would be more easy to image, at least for me.  So I would more prefer perpendicular vector calculations meaning 90 degree from a vector, to get a sense of whats preformed under the hood.  Of course I too wouldn't calculate myself every time. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/14/23, 8:02:23 PM] ‪+971 58 953 6461‬: Guys if you feel your mentored sessions are not giving you enough value, ask the PM to audit other sessions.. you can choose someone who’s style matches yours! that way you get more value from the time you spend..
[10/14/23, 8:14:55 PM] ‪+52 55 9110 5256‬: What's slides are you mentioned here, because there are a lot slides

[10/14/23, 8:24:03 PM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: So who is the best one so far ?
[10/14/23, 8:39:06 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: I just wrote to my PM to ask for a change of mentored session so I’ll see this weekend hopefully. If anyone can recommend me a group to join please I’m all eyes 👀
[10/14/23, 8:49:25 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: We can do that?
[10/14/23, 8:52:08 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: I really don’t know but I hope so, I really don’t fit with my profesor. It must be me but I hope PM can help me

[10/14/23, 11:03:14 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: Did everyone get the eigenvector centrality?
[10/14/23, 11:17:44 PM] ‪+65 8303 1879‬: In short .. Just think a vector u want to apply on a matrix and that matrix is not changing it's direction,.. don't know its proper example but u can visualize a picture on computer and resize it to make small or big, the factor that image matrix is Multiplying and image is not destroyed is eigenvector.

Was helpful on Math but am not yet well struck by the fact that eigenvector = evaluate node accounted with neighbor node's degrees. ‎<This message was edited>

Watch up to time stamp 6:30. It shows the algorithm application and eigen vector calculation comes up with similar results. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/15/23, 9:08:40 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: No, no, no... trust me, nothing to be embarrassed about.   I still have "empty spaces" in my brain 🧠 for material even from Week 1... I asked because I thought that we were going to need this model again.  I started things with almost a 1.5-2 week delay.... last week has been hard!
[10/15/23, 9:09:50 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: I would loved, for example, to do the optional exercises to reinforce the knowledge, but it has been humanly impossible.  Hey, and that's the reason of this group, to help each other 😉

Therefore, THANKS 😊
[10/15/23, 10:36:02 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: @19494136369 spent whole day studying from your notes, thanks a bunch 🙌

[10/15/23, 11:58:36 AM] ‪+966 55 890 0805‬: What is your suggestions
[10/15/23, 11:58:58 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Long ago or today
[10/15/23, 11:59:11 AM] ‪+966 55 890 0805‬: Today
[10/15/23, 11:59:18 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Give it some time
[10/15/23, 11:59:26 AM] ‪+966 55 890 0805‬: Ok ✅
[10/15/23, 11:59:27 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: It takes time to register that you attended
[10/15/23, 11:59:35 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Tomorrow should be fine 👍

[10/15/23, 12:05:26 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: i would love to see top 10 best reports,  if these guys share it.  wouldn’t hurt asking.
[10/15/23, 12:05:42 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: post evaluation of course
[10/15/23, 12:06:04 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: For the full code one it'd be more or less the same, would differ for the low code version only
[10/15/23, 12:06:14 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: I had it twice alteady.  I used the great learning ticket to ask to amend them and they were corrected.
[10/15/23, 12:06:45 PM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: Can we create a folder and we can all put our projects there so we can learn from each other
[10/15/23, 12:06:55 PM] ‪+966 55 890 0805‬: Thanks for the update
[10/15/23, 12:07:21 PM] ‪+966 55 890 0805‬: How raise a ticket ?
[10/15/23, 12:08:56 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: Not a bad idea.. one can put there after stuff is graded and everyone has submitted.   but it can drift easily into shortcuts, copying if not timed well.  so slightly arguable step.
[10/15/23, 12:09:30 PM] Han: I don’t trust the links in the email/invites that they send us.  I make sure to click from the link in the dashboard.
[10/15/23, 12:09:36 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: I’n not in front of the PC so might not be accurate but go to faq or ask question and at the mentor session section write the issue and ask for amendment
[10/15/23, 12:09:49 PM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: Post grading I meant
[10/15/23, 12:10:18 PM] ‪+966 55 890 0805‬: 👍
[10/15/23, 12:11:16 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: feel free to make a google shared drive with shared upload access.  lets see how far it goes.   proper folder and  README.txt file can guide through it
[10/15/23, 12:12:57 PM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: May be we can create a WhatsApp community in this same group instead of google drive and admins can do it. This can help drive clarifications in the group as well ‎<This message was edited>
[10/15/23, 12:16:45 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: I’ve no experience with community feature,  it gets very chatty shortly.   In drive its easy to see files etc and re-upload and put xtra material.   Infact more i type this,  shared drive feels good way to share our stuff.
[10/15/23, 12:18:52 PM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: Community is just another WhatsApp group but we can mention no chats for that group
[10/15/23, 12:18:53 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: Let me make one,  lets see.   on it.
[10/15/23, 12:19:08 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: i mean the drive option
[10/15/23, 12:19:42 PM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: Reason is that many May share easily if it was WhatsApp group hence my suggestion

Thought I’d share for anyone looking for a good resource for actually using and applying PCA to python I found this very helpful in making PCA more applicable and less just theory and concepts
[10/15/23, 12:39:05 PM] ‪+1 (904) 613‑3377‬: As someone who is not well equipped in python this was excellent
[10/15/23, 12:42:17 PM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: For someone who started Python 2-3 weeks like me 😁

[10/15/23, 1:10:12 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: We still didn't start learning ML, we have plenty of time before we should start getting worried about failing
[10/15/23, 2:02:37 PM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: I dont think anyone will fail, as 60% is passing fingers crossed.
[10/15/23, 2:02:58 PM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Prior to project it would be nice to create a guideline or discuss it..
[10/15/23, 2:03:06 PM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: So all of us can benefit
[10/15/23, 2:03:10 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: We can calculate how many will fail
[10/15/23, 2:03:34 PM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Right just hoping nobody fails
[10/15/23, 2:04:15 PM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: The guy I talked to before signing up said the pass rate was 95%. And if you don't pass or finish, you automatically get enrolled in the next cohort
[10/15/23, 2:04:45 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Automatically get enrolled, and pay again? Or second free trial
[10/15/23, 2:04:48 PM] ‪+1 (647) 278‑6277‬: Oh i thought someone mentioned here 60% is passing
[10/15/23, 2:05:01 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: 60% is passing grade
[10/15/23, 2:05:08 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: 95% passing rate
[10/15/23, 2:05:26 PM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: You need score of 60% in each course to pass
[10/15/23, 2:05:50 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Actually reminds me, anyone understood the "professional certificate" thing with the extra courses?
[10/15/23, 2:06:21 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Seemed like courses that cost +$2,000 for 2 or 3 days each

[10/15/23, 2:33:12 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Import the data every week, and merge them
[10/15/23, 2:34:18 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: And eliminate the duplicates by pandas.
I can do that🤣
[10/15/23, 2:34:56 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: What will we do with the data tho
[10/15/23, 2:35:14 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Maybe train a model to talk like a member of the group
[10/15/23, 2:35:28 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: Look for correlation of post to grades
[10/15/23, 2:35:44 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: The more you text, the less your grades are
[10/15/23, 2:36:03 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: I think it is true.
[10/15/23, 2:36:07 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Well, I am texting mid-class now, so adds up 💀
[10/15/23, 2:36:28 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: That will be our null hypothesis
[10/15/23, 2:36:43 PM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: This Ha So do you have the right sampling :)
[10/15/23, 2:37:56 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: So basically just need to count how many messages per number
[10/15/23, 2:38:08 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Preferably during each week ‎<This message was edited>
[10/15/23, 2:38:22 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: And see their grade for that week's quiz
[10/15/23, 2:38:26 PM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: We have to get a threshold to = and then determine the tail method
[10/15/23, 2:38:46 PM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: Number of messages to consider too much or too low
[10/15/23, 2:39:08 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: We can make a regression model to predict our grades depending on how much we text in a given week
[10/15/23, 2:39:16 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Yeah
[10/15/23, 2:39:56 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Speaking of which, I should try to pay attention to class 🙌

[10/15/23, 3:15:40 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Correct.  Additionally, I am just taking also a quick check of the summary notes provided after each session , just to make sure I am capturing all details, and add it to my notes in the slides if I am missing something important.  I am planning to take it like in 2-3 hours.
[10/15/23, 3:16:20 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Don't be scared... I am saying 2-3 hours not because of the amount of material, but because I need to do intermitently some house cleaning 🤣
[10/15/23, 3:17:06 PM] ‪+1 (650) 374‑8786‬: I want to get it done with as well
[10/15/23, 3:18:32 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: I'm doing the quiz now, it's way easier than you think
[10/15/23, 3:18:37 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Less than 5 mins
[10/15/23, 3:18:46 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Will send the answers in a moment 🙃
[10/15/23, 3:25:25 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: I finished it, just re-re-revising everything to make sure I made no silly mistakes 💀
[10/15/23, 3:28:25 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: In DBSCAN, ε is the radius no? In the question it says "the neighbourhood around a data point", sounds the same, is it?
[10/15/23, 3:28:54 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Heck yeah 30/30
[10/15/23, 3:29:19 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: What was the question here?

And i was clicking around stuff few mins ago and happened to open LowCode version template file (which not sure why i had not done earlier) and my eyes popped out to see that its already got so much initial code in there,  ready made !!
[10/15/23, 6:56:20 PM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: I am sure low code version guys had to write more english,  but full code guys could use low-code template to get head start.

And squeeze in sometime coming week to do week3 practice and other reading materials. Lot of info to absorb and remember. I literally spent 9 hrs last 2 days - my head is exploding now.

[10/16/23, 12:36:11 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: All right I will add country from phone number and try to analyze more in my free time.
[10/16/23, 12:38:47 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: See online if there's a dictionary of mobile number country codes and countries
[10/16/23, 12:39:17 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: I think I can find them googling
[10/16/23, 12:39:38 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: Machine Learning starts tomorrow, new chapter starts tomorrow, we have a class tomorrow morning, looks like this time supervised learning.
[10/16/23, 12:40:29 AM] ‪+56 9 6422 7805‬: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes
[10/16/23, 12:41:34 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Then simply:

[10/16/23, 12:41:41 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: I think this should be right
[10/16/23, 12:44:15 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: First we need to have clear Objective as to what needs to be Accomplished, given this Domain. The Domain here is facebooks messages having different discussions on Different topics, during different timelines "week1, week2, week3"by differnt numbers from different geographic locations. Sub goals: --> 1)perform preliminary steps: PCA and tSNE 2) see if Clustering is needed as a next step. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/16/23, 12:44:33 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: I would prefer to add country code columns from phone number and prepare a separate country code dataframe and merge them.

[10/16/23, 1:40:58 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: And get along most
[10/16/23, 1:41:22 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: And make a recommender systems model to recommend to group members who they would get along well with
[10/16/23, 1:42:29 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Maybe sentiment analysis to create a weight for each message (how positive/negative) so we can have our weight vector for the recommendation systems model
[10/16/23, 1:42:45 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: So NLP+Recommender Systems
[10/16/23, 1:43:16 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: So it'll be user based
[10/16/23, 1:43:33 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: I think I should be able to do it once we have a large enough dataset

Goid afternoon all,
This link is to the first of a series of 4 videos from Stanford on multiple hypothesis testing error correction: it explains FWER, FDR, Bonferroni,Bonferroni-Holmes and Benjamini-Hochberg in a little more depth with clear examples. Helped me understand better.

It is part of a larger series of 105 short videos on Statistical Learning, some of which cover PCA and Clustering.
[10/16/23, 3:30:50 AM] ‪+49 176 23224829‬: Did get anyone the FoodHub project evaluated yet?
[10/16/23, 4:06:09 AM] ‪+49 176 23224829‬: Maybe end of this week 🧐
[10/16/23, 4:59:24 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: For the upcoming weeks, the following link will be useful:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/
GeekForGeeks has a lot of really good material to build intuition behind ML algs with both the code & math explained very well
[10/16/23, 7:51:17 AM] ‪+49 176 23224829‬: Just went through todays presentation. It’s gonna be very challenging today… 🤪
[10/16/23, 7:54:26 AM] ‪+33 6 84 02 80 10‬: @Jenson : you can watch this video , it makes it helped me understand the linear regression. There are more videos from this channel explaining all the concepts that we be presented in tonight's lecture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYTumjgE2IY&list=RDCMUC6AVa0vSrCpuskzGDDKz_EQ&index=9
[10/16/23, 7:59:35 AM] ‪+49 176 23224829‬: That’s gonna be a long day covering it 😂😂😂
[10/16/23, 8:20:03 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: What are they going to cover?
[10/16/23, 8:20:46 AM] ‪+56 9 6422 7805‬: supervised learning  &linear regression
[10/16/23, 8:32:21 AM] ‪+49 176 23224829‬: Yep
[10/16/23, 8:41:19 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: Just saw in lecture slides for linear regression, they want us to 1.find a formula with some parameters, 2 then find a solution, 3 then do intrepretation
[10/16/23, 8:41:35 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: On a high level
[10/16/23, 9:01:11 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Linear regression is basically the formula of order one polynomials "y=θ_1+θ_2x"
Where θ_1 is the y intercept, and θ_2 is the slope.
We draw a line, calculate the mean square error from the actual data points, which is what we want to minimise.
To minimise, we can take the derivative ans solve for it = 0 (since derivative=0 is minimum and maximum).
We get a new formula to use and find the parameters that minimise the mean square error function, which represents our best line aka the regression line
[10/16/23, 9:58:46 AM] ‪+1 (437) 973‑9491‬: At least this gentleman is trying to answer questions that this group has. Hope he is as good as he is looking at the moment!
[10/16/23, 9:59:26 AM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: Yes, I already like him better
[10/16/23, 9:59:33 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: I agree.  I like his pace, and the fact that he is explaining notation that sometimes people (including me) sometimes are shy to ask.
[10/16/23, 10:00:18 AM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: Yes this professor is great. But to give the credit to others, they were teaching technical which is not much of the scope of the course
[10/16/23, 10:00:40 AM] ‪+1 (909) 362‑2376‬: I think the approach he is taking is awesome. He is teaching with the assumption that we don’t know anything
[10/16/23, 10:01:46 AM] ‪+1 (909) 362‑2376‬: This is the approach that everyone should take for a class of over 100 people. It is better to explain at the lowest possible level so everyone understands
[10/16/23, 10:02:44 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: I can not believe it, this guy at least makes pauses to breath like any normal human! 🤣🤣🤣
[10/16/23, 10:03:25 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: The last prof didn't breath 🤣
[10/16/23, 10:03:33 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: lol
[10/16/23, 10:03:34 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: How come he has all the time to answer questions, when Caroline did not
[10/16/23, 10:04:13 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: Can we go and change our ratings for Caroline lol
[10/16/23, 10:05:33 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: idk I hope the pace remains constant. With prof Caroline the last 30 minutes had almost 40% of the content
[10/16/23, 10:05:47 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: I think it was good that first Prof. was Caroline... it was like a wake-up call at least for me, and some "fire" under my feet.... that put me in permanent "alert" status. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/16/23, 10:05:49 AM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: But let’s not make that much questions otherwise he could run out of time please 🙏🏻 just as recommendation
[10/16/23, 10:07:32 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: We can keep the questions for the 30 mins after class with the GL faculty, or discuss in the group here
[10/16/23, 10:08:25 AM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: And let him keep going because some question are sure to be answered as he continuéis
[10/16/23, 10:08:31 AM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Continues*
[10/16/23, 10:08:38 AM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: He is trying to explain
[10/16/23, 10:09:05 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: I agree, guys.... calm down with those questions
[10/16/23, 10:09:36 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: I am sure, he will change his pace.. he is just introducing, showing that he is receptive to questions, in other words he is connecting to audience :) i am sure he won't take the whole 2 hours answering questions from chat. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/16/23, 10:11:51 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: E is error???
[10/16/23, 10:12:02 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Expected value @18573818612
[10/16/23, 10:12:21 AM] ‪+56 9 6422 7805‬: expected value of the error
[10/16/23, 10:15:22 AM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: G is like the function
[10/16/23, 10:18:02 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: g is a function that takes in vector X and outputs vector Y
[10/16/23, 10:18:22 AM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Yes it is
[10/16/23, 10:20:56 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: what is theta?
[10/16/23, 10:21:12 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: A Greek letter (⁠☞ﾟ⁠ヮﾟ⁠)⁠☞
[10/16/23, 10:21:13 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: It is the coefficient for X(i)
[10/16/23, 10:21:18 AM] ‪+56 9 6422 7805‬: constants, that makes the model fits
[10/16/23, 10:21:27 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: y = mx + b (m would be theta)
[10/16/23, 10:21:34 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: ok
[10/16/23, 10:21:53 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: b would be theta(0) to be complete in the prev example
[10/16/23, 10:21:57 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: theta 0 = b right?
[10/16/23, 10:22:04 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Technically θ_n is the coefficient of the n-th term
[10/16/23, 10:22:13 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: theta(1) = m theta(0) = b
[10/16/23, 10:22:18 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Or the n-th independent variable
[10/16/23, 10:22:33 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: for y = mx + b)
[10/16/23, 10:24:21 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: His explanation is very clear. 💯
[10/16/23, 10:26:57 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: dont' try to look at the formula 🤣
[10/16/23, 10:27:55 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: The complicated way to derive it would be to set the mean squared error to 0 and do some funky math to get the foormula
[10/16/23, 10:38:52 AM] ‪+506 7209 1200‬: React to this if you have not grasped ANYTHING in the class 😓 even though the professor has explained the class in the best way .. I was understanding at the beginning but then I lost it completely.
[10/16/23, 10:43:12 AM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: How is theta calculated?
[10/16/23, 10:44:06 AM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: Looks like we understand but not understanding the content. Lol ‎<This message was edited>
[10/16/23, 10:44:16 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: The formula that was shown theta = (X^T*X)^-1*(X^T*Y)
[10/16/23, 10:44:32 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: I am working and need to watch his lecture later, watch it one more time you will get it
[10/16/23, 10:46:07 AM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: I have to attend a meeting, If I drop now, will I be marked as absent for today’s lecture?
[10/16/23, 10:46:57 AM] ‪+1 (781) 296‑2531‬: These lectures are not mandatory
[10/16/23, 10:47:03 AM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: This is optional
[10/16/23, 10:47:10 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: I asked this to my Program manager and she said, we can watch the video later. So don’t worry
[10/16/23, 10:47:34 AM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: Perfect thanks
[10/16/23, 10:49:24 AM] ‪+1 (408) 908‑0220‬: They may not be mandatory but this is where most of the learning really comes besides what you do on your own. The mentored sessions are good for programming but not so much for everything else.
[10/16/23, 10:50:07 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: It happened, we're running low of time vs material, post-break might be the part to rewatch
[10/16/23, 10:51:29 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Yep! The pace was too good to be true :( the stuff after R^2 from the slides seems interesting
[10/16/23, 10:54:40 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: what was the ideal case?
[10/16/23, 10:54:54 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: R^2 = 1
[10/16/23, 10:55:07 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: as long as you can watch it later, that should be fine. Or else leave the meeting on mute, like I did. I am acting Deaf 🧏😆
[10/16/23, 10:55:22 AM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: But that never happens, as long as you have a r2 close to 1 it’s ok
[10/16/23, 10:57:09 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Hehe, thanks, but I meant in terms of RSS and TSS
[10/16/23, 10:57:27 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: RSS = 0 (ideal case)
[10/16/23, 10:57:39 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: @593997050664 , thanks 😊 ... this part I know, I meant in terms of RSS & TSS
[10/16/23, 10:57:54 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: that means there is no residual error (all error has been explained by linear regression)
[10/16/23, 10:59:21 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: Who is getting a noble prize ?
[10/16/23, 11:00:48 AM] ‪+65 8303 1879‬: Those who peace fully listening the lecture: Nobel peace prize 🏆
[10/16/23, 11:02:44 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: Looks like The professors only answers for questions selected by the moderators. The questions are first screened by Ankit and Nirupam and are forwarded to Professor. If they are silly they get dumped.  We do not see this process, but this happens in background.
[10/16/23, 11:02:45 AM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: I spelt Nobel as noble intentionally 🤣, so my question still stands
[10/16/23, 11:04:14 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Wait really?? First lecture i was only replying to host and panelists not "everyone" once I switched I got some questions answered
[10/16/23, 11:06:53 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: May be, that is just my assumption, otherwise how come the Professor can focus on effectively to train the course material as well as scan through 1000's of random questions from an audience of 100plus in given 2 hours and still effectively complete the material. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/16/23, 11:09:05 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: The great learning platform must be having a different view for professors in addition to professional version of Zoom ‎<This message was edited>

[10/16/23, 11:33:53 AM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: 🥲
[10/16/23, 11:34:33 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Totally missing my half day of my job for this - worth it
[10/16/23, 11:35:29 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: And he's answering the questions instead of them 😂
[10/16/23, 11:38:13 AM] ‪+51 964 257 681‬: He is doing an excellent job 10/10
[10/16/23, 11:38:17 AM] ‪+56 9 6422 7805‬: Nice!
[10/16/23, 11:39:08 AM] ‪+1 (305) 804‑3912‬: Great Prof! Good class.

[10/16/23, 11:40:39 AM] ‪+1 (781) 296‑2531‬: One positive from Prof Uhler's lectures is more people joined this group because they were confused 😄
[10/16/23, 11:40:49 AM] ‪+1 (305) 804‑3912‬: I like the fact he took one practical example and ran with it step-by-step. 

It may feel overwhelming now, but after the review it will all make sense
[10/16/23, 11:41:05 AM] ‪+971 56 271 1606‬: We wouldn’t have a group if it weren’t for prof Uhler ‎<This message was edited>
[10/16/23, 11:41:47 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: I feel Prof. Uhler's material was a little more technical and demanding, she wasn't doing that bad of a job
[10/16/23, 11:42:43 AM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Social group seems useless now I think 😂
[10/16/23, 11:42:49 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: But yeah, this Prof. is better by kilometres (miles for the fellow Americans)
[10/16/23, 11:43:50 AM] ‪+1 (305) 804‑3912‬: Naturally gifted with the Greek notations. 🤣 🇬🇷 ‎<This message was edited>

[10/16/23, 11:49:22 AM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: Great class today, but still feeling a little lost idk if it’s just me 🥲 need to go thru the post class material for sure
[10/16/23, 11:49:23 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: No, but have handy (or mark with a flag if you have printed slides) the different types of Network Centrality, and examples
[10/16/23, 11:50:15 AM] ‪+1 (650) 374‑8786‬: All the question are conceptual from slides, open the lecture summary on the side, for all 3 lectures by Caroline and do it
[10/16/23, 11:50:31 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: It is not only you, I have the idea because I have gone through linear regression in college.  But back then, some of the things were a little bit more like an act of faith... and now I am seeing the underlying math.
[10/16/23, 11:51:11 AM] ‪+1 (571) 201‑4434‬: Not alone.
[10/16/23, 11:53:27 AM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: We can have another review session on zoom together this week for this week’s material 😂 we can discuss our questions

[10/16/23, 11:53:56 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: When is the quiz for this one due?
[10/16/23, 11:54:15 AM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: 23rd
[10/16/23, 11:55:23 AM] ‪+1 (437) 973‑9491‬: The best thing is he is still hanging around and trying to answer as much as he can.
[10/16/23, 11:55:49 AM] ‪+1 (437) 973‑9491‬: I rated 3 to previous gal. His rating is a definite 5
[10/16/23, 12:37:43 PM] ‪+49 176 23224829‬: Amazing session 🤠👍🏻
[10/16/23, 12:42:24 PM] ‪+971 58 953 6461‬: Prof. Tsitsiklis cares! Felt like he has genuine urge to explain the concepts rather than just going through the script!
[10/16/23, 12:49:49 PM] ‪+1 (314) 827‑8522‬: Totall agree - prof Tsitsiklis rocks
[10/16/23, 1:25:34 PM] ‪+1 (704) 247‑0706‬: Definitely, I’m able to comprehend his session. Past week’s sessions bounced over my head. Thought it’s me who is having trouble picking up stuff.
[10/16/23, 1:53:58 PM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: You are not alone, need to revisit a lot of math again
[10/16/23, 2:04:15 PM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: @33684028010 thank you so much for sharing this video. After Prof’s lecture, I watched it and it helped me a lot to fill the little gaps that was left after the lecture.
[10/16/23, 2:59:34 PM] ‪+1 (650) 374‑8786‬: Best video thanks for sharing

[10/16/23, 4:28:25 PM] ‪+1 (703) 309‑3099‬: That was an excellent video and well worth the time if you need to build intuition about regression.   Thank you Varuni.
[10/16/23, 4:40:03 PM] ‪+1 (704) 962‑4113‬: I'm catching up,, reviewing & prepping for the quiz, any opinions how difficult it was from 1-10, 10 being extremely hard
[10/16/23, 4:40:39 PM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: If you read the papers only it should be 3
[10/16/23, 4:40:54 PM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: As all the questions covered in the lectures paper work
[10/16/23, 4:41:05 PM] ‪+1 (650) 374‑8786‬: Quiz 3 is from summary notes if all 3 sessions of caroline I had to look up notes as it was theoretical and I couldnt remember much
[10/16/23, 4:42:48 PM] ‪+1 (704) 962‑4113‬: So reviewing prof Caroline's live class and slides for familiarity  should be good prep?
[10/16/23, 4:43:18 PM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: And keep them handy as you can all the time use them as a reference
[10/16/23, 4:43:23 PM] ‪+1 (650) 374‑8786‬: Yes should be fine
[10/16/23, 4:43:53 PM] ‪+1 (704) 962‑4113‬: Thanks Everyone for feedback and guidance!

[10/16/23, 9:51:04 PM] ‪+52 55 1991 4929‬: I guess what we learn is what matters most. I would not worry about the grade. As long as we get a score of 60 in each of the courses we get the MIT Certificate and it does not show a grade
[10/16/23, 10:39:07 PM] ‪+1 (437) 973‑9491‬: Does any one feel that even after giving the quiz you don’t know anything about the subject. I am still feeling lost in this Data Analysis and Visualization course :(
[10/16/23, 10:40:05 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Yes hahaha I do feel like that but no worries, that’s why we have 3 years of context
[10/16/23, 10:40:07 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: Content*
[10/16/23, 10:41:49 PM] ‪+52 55 2947 9262‬: I feel when coding but overall I do understand the EDA
[10/16/23, 10:47:13 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: As long as you understand when to use what, the how is just ctrl+c, ctrl+v from Stack Overflow & reading documentation
[10/16/23, 10:58:59 PM] ‪+1 (909) 362‑2376‬: I watched the recordings of Prof  Uhler’s lectures at 2x speed today and then took the quiz. I scored a 100% but I’m not terribly happy because to be honest, I knew the answers to about 50% of the questions and knew where to find the answers for the rest of them.
[10/16/23, 11:03:00 PM] ‪+1 (408) 687‑8705‬: Exactly we are obsorbing  concepts at a very high rate before settling in on earlier weeks content. Onto Week3 finally.
[10/16/23, 11:03:42 PM] ‪+52 55 9110 5256‬: well, quiz with open books are not so easy indeed because you need to understand to find out what the answer is, so you should be happy to got 100 ‎<This message was edited>

[10/16/23, 11:13:33 PM] ‪+1 (437) 973‑9491‬: I have the exact same feeling!
[10/16/23, 11:13:57 PM] ‪+966 50 743 1948‬: In my opinion, getting through the exams and  marks is helpful for us to review the content and understand the basic concepts. However, the main aim should be to have practical hands on along with the full understanding to explain it.
[10/16/23, 11:16:20 PM] ‪+966 50 743 1948‬: Looks great idea to grasp many concepts in a single view.
[10/16/23, 11:29:02 PM] ‪+1 (704) 962‑4113‬: Completely agree
[10/16/23, 11:33:23 PM] ‪+1 (704) 962‑4113‬: Too much info too fast. No time to do hands on coding to apply this knowledge and have real questions to ask while we have guidance. 
Wish there was a better balance of theory and hands on  learning.
[10/16/23, 11:41:53 PM] ‪+1 (408) 908‑0220‬: I found that going through the optional guided portions has been the most helpful in really understanding and applying what we are getting from the professors. I just open a notebook in colab and start from scratch. You learn way more than going through all the other things they have, and it is practical knowledge.
[10/16/23, 11:47:33 PM] ‪+1 (314) 827‑8522‬: Just finished my quiz - just with the videos I scored 27/30

[10/17/23, 8:23:46 AM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: So we know some good examples done by others

[10/17/23, 8:24:54 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: You are not supposed to share your file for the integrity of current and future courses
[10/17/23, 8:25:38 AM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: After grading I guess shouldn’t be issue .. I’m open to hear though
[10/17/23, 8:26:37 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: Otherwise 3 months later these files will be posted on the internet. This course or certificate will not have any value.

[10/17/23, 8:35:09 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: Imagine, i have 500 cousins, if i share this file. All of them will already know the answers when they take the course in January. So much effort we put in. For them it is effortless. Even a highschooler can pass if they know the answers ahead of the time.
[10/17/23, 8:42:51 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: Well may be they may change foodhub to someother project in the January course, then it is ok
[10/17/23, 8:43:49 AM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: Your point does have ethical stand Naveen, I like that you raised it. At same time nothing stops some one with bad ethics to share their file outside cohort. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/17/23, 8:51:13 AM] ‪+91 97390 32951‬: "We are doing this course to gain knowledge and make use of this course," I believe. Sharing answers after evaluation can help us understand different ways of tackling problems across the worldwide students. Aside from the classes, we had the opportunity to get to know one another. ‎<This message was edited>

Anybody can have access to HBS case studies online as well but the instructor, approach, teaching methodology, frameworks applied, self learning and group projects make all the difference! 
Same applies to this course!

[10/17/23, 9:13:29 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Did you guys write a lot for Q17?
[10/17/23, 9:13:33 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Or just a sentence or two
[10/17/23, 9:14:07 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Full code people not low code (since I believe low code spend most of the effort on Q17)
[10/17/23, 9:14:29 AM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: I wrote few sentences
[10/17/23, 9:15:25 AM] ‪+1 (732) 762‑5126‬: Those who got the evaluation back, were they low code or full code? I did full code and don’t have the results yet

[10/17/23, 9:19:52 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: I made only one mistake ~that I noticed~, wrote "weekend" for both the weekdays and weekends when showing average delivery time, calculation is right, just sentence printed is wrong
[10/17/23, 9:20:00 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: They would deduct for that?

[10/17/23, 9:25:05 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: He was saying that asking the people who got evaluated, full or low code, since he's full code and didn't get result, wanted to see if low code are getting first before full code or it's a mix

As of now your original score for the two quizzes is computed against the 90 (along with the few whose grades for food hub  are uploadaed). Hope I make sense

I have been struggling to keep track of all the info in our class - from notes, python code, slides,  formulas, website links and more..

When I started I was using EXCEL,but it quickly grew out of control so I started using Microsoft's ONENOTE tool instead and for me its been great,
ONENOTE is basically a super notebook that i can keep track of everything on one place with tabs for different courses contains screenshots of important info, slides, python code and my notes. 

When you copy data from web sites and paste into ONENOTE it stores a link to the source website with it.

Using the SNIP tool i can grab screenshots and add my own highlighting to it then paste them into ONENOTE as well.

Using these tools is helping me get organized so I wanted to share this in case others are struggling to keep all their info organized.
Hope this helps others

[10/17/23, 8:52:40 PM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: My understanding is that First step, theta is figured out for y hat using only the formula inv(Xt X) Xt Y for the training dataset. This theta combined with X gives us the regression function g
Next, for the training set, error is figured out as sum of squared reciprocals and then this is minimized using derivative,
That will optimize the regression function

It might be good to make a vote for FoodHub project scores like as histogram bin 90-81, 80-71, 70-61, 60-51 and so on. - but can be biased because I think people with low scores wouldn't want to vote. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/18/23, 9:34:07 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Theta^ is the coefficient vector for the regression. This is derived by minimizing the loss function. When you minimize the loss function (sum of squares) you get the formula theta^ = (XtX)^-1 * XtY
[10/18/23, 9:41:26 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Setting the derivative of sum of squares to 0 (minimizing the loss function) will give the formula Theta^ = (XtX)^-1 * XtY

[10/18/23, 1:27:22 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: Actually, I already have a question🤣  The principle analysis PC1 fitted line and the regression formula(line) is different right?  I was thinking at first it seems same but, the PC1 fitted line has no theta0 and will be stretched as possible and the regression formula doesn't stretch and has theta0.  So it is different.  Am I correct?
[10/18/23, 1:31:28 PM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: @18573818612  when we do PCA, we are transforming the data, and PC1 is combination of significant variables transformed onto eigenvector.
When you build a linear regression model, your variables exist in their own independent space , no transformation occurs, you are only combining the each of the variable - it tells how much of the variation in dependent variable is explained by each of the independent variable.
[10/18/23, 1:31:42 PM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: And so yes, they are different
[10/18/23, 1:33:41 PM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: Also, like Prof said, we could use PCA to remedy multicollinearity but it becomes difficult to explain how much variation in dependent variable each of the independent variable of PCA has, due to the transformation, and hence not preferred
[10/18/23, 1:35:33 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: @17346358370 , and here I would like to ask you: from today's lecture, if I understood correctly the Professor, he said that when we don't know if one of the "independent" variables we are considering for our model is not actually independent, but the linear combination of two existing ones, is when we use PCA in Linear Regression?  But just as an auxiliary tool to "dump" those factors which are not actual "independent" variables, but the combination of two existing ones?
[10/18/23, 1:36:11 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: And then, from the PCA, we "dump" that cluster that shows the less dispersion, is this correct?
[10/18/23, 1:37:43 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: So the fitted line is totally different? (equation won't have theta0)
I want to visualize both lines on 3D but is it possible???
[10/18/23, 1:38:53 PM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: I am not sure about dumping, from what I remember he said you dump one of the variables of the two which do not show independence OR use PCA to combine them into one and use
[10/18/23, 1:39:50 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: remember what criteria to use to determine which one does not show independence?
[10/18/23, 1:39:55 PM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: Fitted line has theta0 but no noise Wi. Actual data has Wi which contributes towards error or risk of the model
[10/18/23, 1:40:51 PM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: I think it was Xr almost equal to Xtv. The link I shared 👆shows a great example of this

[10/18/23, 1:41:43 PM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Thing of the data points scattered in n dimensional space. 

What PCA does essentially is that it says okay there are some dimensions that don’t really matter because the points don’t very too much in that direction. So let me just keep the directions where the data points vary the most and project my original data onto these new directions. 

Linear regression says I think my output is linear to a combination of my n dimensions. So let me find the line that has the best fit to all these n dimensions.

You can say my n is too big so I want to reduce my dimensions. Then you would use pca on the data points first. Then find a linear regression that is a predictor for the best fit line. @18573818612
[10/18/23, 1:41:58 PM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: *vary for very ^
[10/18/23, 1:43:45 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: @16306996948 , in this case you are using "n" as the amount of factors (independent variables)? right?
[10/18/23, 1:44:38 PM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Yep
[10/18/23, 1:45:04 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Sorry for asking something maybe too obvious, but the documentation in the summary confuses me when it uses sometimes the m for the factors (independent variables) and some others the n, which he originally said it was going to be used for the amount of observations...
[10/18/23, 1:45:50 PM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Sorry yeah n is usually for the rows (number of data points) m for the independent variables (features)
[10/18/23, 1:46:36 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Nothing to apologize for, you are great with these explanations.  It is just that the documentation in some points takes "smoke" out of my head 😁
[10/18/23, 1:48:21 PM] ‪+593 99 705 0664‬: I think the key in that in Linear regression you assume there is a linear relation and before doing PCA you really know nothing about the data and you are asking the code to tell you how it behaves, right? @16306996948 ‎<This message was edited>
[10/18/23, 1:50:20 PM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Yes more specifically in pca you’re asking what’re the most important ways (eigenvectors) in which my data behaves
[10/18/23, 1:51:36 PM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: But also we assume linear relationship in pca

I would say create the above groups so you can work a lot collaboratively.

[10/19/23, 8:50:28 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: Hi guys i understood that we take best fit that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals, where the residuals are the differences between the actual values and the predicted values of the dependent variable as opposed the difference of the absolute, we do this for mathematical simplicity.
[10/19/23, 8:53:41 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: I took for granted that sum of squared residuals is better than differences of absolute just because professor said that guass went with this approach. Even chatgpt said the same. But how it is simple?
[10/19/23, 8:56:47 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: Sum of theta X - y squared is better rhan absolute x -absolute y
[10/19/23, 8:58:03 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: Why Squares are better than Absolutes???
[10/19/23, 8:59:30 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: I hope i am asking the question correctly
[10/19/23, 9:02:30 AM] ‪+1 (438) 357‑9685‬: Bcz you will always get positive value
[10/19/23, 9:02:50 AM] ‪+1 (438) 357‑9685‬: Without square might you encounter with negative value
[10/19/23, 9:13:47 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Absolutes give positive as well
[10/19/23, 9:14:11 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: The reason we choose squares and not absolutes is that absolutes are more difficult to deal with
[10/19/23, 9:14:37 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: However, the mean absolute error function is still used a lot for other applications, just not this one
[10/19/23, 9:17:47 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: From my experience in linear regression, to minimize the function we take it's derivative, the derivative of the square is trivial, however the derivative of the absolute function is a little more of a headache to get and proceed on computing with
[10/19/23, 9:20:28 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Plus (unsure if this is the case here, but probably is), in quantum physics, we use square instead of absolute value to enlarge the gap between numbers, the small stays small, and the large becomes even larger, so we can more accurately distinguish the noise in the regression being "not by chance"
[10/19/23, 9:21:27 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: I hope this answers your question (⁠☞⁠ ⁠ಠ⁠_⁠ಠ⁠)⁠☞

I know that here the Prof. solved with linear algebra and not calculus, but point stays the same, absolute value is just a headache to deal with, squares are simpler

[10/19/23, 9:53:40 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: The prof did use calculus with linear algebra :) The derivative just wasn’t shown. I think the main reason as you said is coefficients in L2 get penalized less since the square of a small number is an even smaller number. So theta can still be near 0 but greater than 0. However with absolute value some of the thetas are fully driven to zero since the penalty is constant.
[10/19/23, 9:55:31 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: But idk if one is strictly better

[10/19/23, 9:59:24 AM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: Hey!, got a question for all the folks already in the world of data science and analysis. So, when it comes to working as a data scientist out there in the real world, do you need to be a total pro in the specific industry you're working in? Or is the stuff we're diving into in this course enough for someone to become data science whiz?
[10/19/23, 10:00:30 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Depends on what seniority level you're applying to, if internship or a junior level, you just need to be familiar with few supervised and unsupervised algs, and be pretty decent in coding
[10/19/23, 10:00:37 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: But this course is not enough to be a data scientist
[10/19/23, 10:00:47 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Other than python, you need to learn few things

[10/19/23, 10:37:58 AM] ‪+31 6 13722803‬: One thing I want to address is that DS also do online and offline experiment. This course doesnt cover in this part but it’s highly used in business.

Moreover, it also depends on if you’re embedded with a product team or not. In some companies, they don’t call it DS. Instead, it’s machine learning scientist. And for those providing analytical insights, they are DS analytics/DS insights. But some call them analysts. Vice versa. Some are called analysts but they’re actually doing ds insights jobs.

I think it’s better to look at the job description and requirement, then you got a better understanding about the position ‎<This message was edited>

[10/19/23, 10:52:16 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Going back to this, Euler invented graph theory, has immense contributions in every single field of mathematics, has work in physics, engineering, geography, astronomy, even music theory (read one of his music theory papers, he was trying to reinvent sheet music as a whole 💀 didn't workout tho, but still A for effort)

Its pretty simple are quickly graph things and do linear regression and capture residuals too.

[10/19/23, 6:16:07 PM] ‪+1 (909) 362‑2376‬: I would suggest that you try to use this course on multiple categories. Try to get as many as you need. PMI can deny if they don’t like it but they won’t give it to you if you don’t ask
[10/19/23, 6:17:51 PM] ‪+966 55 221 1396‬: Yes I agree 😍,, if anyone is meeting on Dubai from mid Nov to 4th dec, count me in. I’ll be in Dubai during that time

[10/19/23, 7:53:46 PM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: What is the point of having separate groups?
[10/19/23, 8:16:32 PM] ‪+1 (437) 973‑9491‬: I agree, but sometimes it’s easier to concentrate on smaller group. This group can suddenly get overwhelming even reading all the messages from last night :)
[10/19/23, 8:17:42 PM] ‪+1 (408) 687‑8705‬: So true.
[10/19/23, 8:27:37 PM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: Understood, but if you guys have some good stuff please share for the broader audience.

[10/20/23, 10:06:29 AM] ‪+49 176 23224829‬: Are you guys not attending the class?
[10/20/23, 10:07:00 AM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: That is one of the way you may decide to treat it, only if the aim is to predict only and not understand the impact of the variables
[10/20/23, 10:07:09 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: I just remebered .. and came to the class at 10:00am 1/2 hour late..
[10/20/23, 10:08:24 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Hehe, nicely done.  I am still a hand-notes taker 😊

[10/20/23, 10:16:57 AM] ‪+49 176 23224829‬: Could you put the link also in Slack?
[10/20/23, 10:26:39 AM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: Sure
[10/20/23, 10:27:16 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: That means we can remove the other variables and see individual analysis easily, Only Radio, only newspaper and only TV very easily.
[10/20/23, 10:40:01 AM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: But in real life we rarely see such few variables. In our example case, yes.
[10/20/23, 10:49:56 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: I like this prof, feeding cookies to goats

[10/20/23, 11:12:45 AM] ‪+52 55 5509 8082‬: Quite high, the attention span of the population has also  reduced
[10/20/23, 11:13:13 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: L(data, θ) is the product of the probabilities of each value?
[10/20/23, 11:14:43 AM] ‪+1 (438) 357‑9685‬: Did anyone completed Quiz 4 ?
[10/20/23, 11:15:09 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: I completed the practice one after first lecture, very easy
[10/20/23, 11:15:18 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: So hopefully actual one is easy as well
[10/20/23, 11:17:05 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Yep! Also same as probability of each value in each class
[10/20/23, 11:17:22 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Makes sense
[10/20/23, 11:17:54 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: And we took log(L) since log(Π)=Σlog() which is easier to deal with?
[10/20/23, 11:18:02 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Or there's another reason than just simplicity
[10/20/23, 11:18:03 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Exactly!
[10/20/23, 11:18:08 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Ah nice

[10/20/23, 11:20:10 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Yeah
[10/20/23, 11:20:10 AM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: Need to see outliers
[10/20/23, 11:22:20 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Pro tip, for all "k" dependant algorithms, just run a for loop and print all accuracy percentages, then select the best 🌚
[10/20/23, 11:22:23 AM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: It is not the professor it is the student brain like mine getting roasted

[10/20/23, 12:12:17 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Decision trees are very easy math and theory wise, but big headache coding wise

[10/20/23, 12:13:43 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: From my understanding, random forest is decision trees many times, and take what the majority says

[10/20/23, 12:18:46 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Support vector machine
[10/20/23, 12:18:57 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Basically we have data tangled in 2d space
[10/20/23, 12:19:02 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: We can't classify
[10/20/23, 12:19:08 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: So introduce a third dimension
[10/20/23, 12:19:15 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: And split it there using a 2d plane

To be honest, with my work and with the readings I have to do of every topic before and after the sessions I barely have time to do any practice project that is not those of the Mentored sessions.  Does anyone have the chance to do those?
[10/20/23, 12:28:36 PM] ‪+1 (650) 374‑8786‬: I hvnt as there is no time for that barely catching up

[10/20/23, 12:36:06 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: But since we are supposed to keep our access for 3 years... I think those could be later addressed at our own pace.
[10/20/23, 12:38:15 PM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Finished this weeks quiz. It’s a thinker but pretty representative of all lectures. Only conceptual questions but tests understanding a bit more than previous quizzes :) but overall easy - don’t stress

[10/20/23, 12:39:56 PM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: If you find it a thinker then I got to try it only after a complete review again !
[10/20/23, 12:40:28 PM] ‪+1 (650) 374‑8786‬: True that I had to flip pages for last one as well
[10/20/23, 12:45:25 PM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: Nono it’s more of a thinker than the practice quiz that’s all but yes overall review should help you score max :) post class summaries/lecture slides probably help the most.
[10/20/23, 12:47:27 PM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: Last quiz it was the opposite... found harder the practice one than the actual quiz... so, harder this time then...

[10/20/23, 2:23:45 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: You did practice or actual?
[10/20/23, 2:23:50 PM] ‪+1 (647) 878‑9493‬: Are there any calculations required or is it mainly theory?
[10/20/23, 2:23:54 PM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: Both
[10/20/23, 2:24:00 PM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: Only theory
[10/20/23, 2:24:07 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Why did you do actual if you didn't finish watching all...
[10/20/23, 2:24:43 PM] ‪+1 (925) 303‑9165‬: Because I don't know when I'll have time to watch and I've done all the reading and gone over all the slides

[10/20/23, 2:26:37 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: But to do that we need a good number of people online

[10/21/23, 7:45:01 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7121173401100034049?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android
[10/21/23, 7:45:17 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Why don't they teach us how to do this 🧐
[10/21/23, 8:06:33 AM] ‪+52 844 106 9579‬: This is so cool 😱
[10/21/23, 8:07:27 AM] ‪+32 491 19 42 21‬: Did everybody got their scores for assignment?
[10/21/23, 8:07:45 AM] ‪+32 491 19 42 21‬: For the FoodHub assignment
[10/21/23, 8:18:37 AM] ‪+32 491 19 42 21‬: It says the assignment is being graded still
[10/21/23, 8:19:24 AM] ‪+1 (704) 962‑4113‬: Im still waiting on my score for foodhub assignment ☹️☹️
[10/21/23, 8:20:48 AM] ‪+32 491 19 42 21‬: It says “Evaluation pending”
[10/21/23, 8:21:45 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Ikr
[10/21/23, 8:22:17 AM] ‪+91 97390 32951‬: Mine also
[10/21/23, 9:14:02 AM] ‪+1 (908) 477‑1326‬: No.  In my specific case I started the course with some delay and I got an extension on the project, my project has not been graded yet and that's maybe affecting the overall statistics (not sure).
[10/21/23, 9:29:32 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: I guess the Data needs to be treated and simulated ....A data Simulation needs to happen
[10/21/23, 9:42:46 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Usually to make "moving" plots, we save plots as .png, and make them keep showing one by one fast
[10/21/23, 9:43:08 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: But this one has points moving in between clusters, idk how to do that 💀
[10/21/23, 9:43:18 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Probably a specific library imported or smthn
[10/21/23, 9:52:40 AM] ‪+1 (630) 699‑6948‬: There’s probably a time series based visualization library
[10/21/23, 9:53:41 AM] ‪+65 8303 1879‬: Use d3.is
[10/21/23, 9:53:48 AM] ‪+65 8303 1879‬: It’s easy to do using that
[10/21/23, 9:54:18 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: D3.js?
[10/21/23, 9:55:22 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: D3.js is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers.
[10/21/23, 9:55:33 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Yeah
[10/21/23, 9:55:42 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: But what if wanna do it in python
[10/21/23, 9:55:57 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Either we use an API?
[10/21/23, 9:56:13 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Or ig we can use a library to connect the two codes
[10/21/23, 9:56:31 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Remember did smthn like that to connect some code I wrote in python with some code wrote in C
[10/21/23, 9:56:47 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: But still, there should be a python library to do that 🧐
[10/21/23, 9:59:51 AM] ‪+1 (909) 362‑2376‬: Have you all tried plotly? I don’t know anything about it but our mentor had told us that it helps create interactive graphs 
https://plotly.com/python
[10/21/23, 10:01:47 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: I've never used it before, but from the pre-work videos, it makes interactive plots as in you can zoom in/out, rotate, click on data points to views details about them, etc...
[10/21/23, 10:02:09 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Actually woulda been hecka good if we used it in the project 💀 completely forgot about it
[10/21/23, 10:04:27 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: I found a site in Japanese but you can copy and try it with just the code.  It will animate.  It uses only matplotlib.
Very far from the mentioned link but...
https://qiita.com/SwitchBlade/items/47ffac180919969ab32e
[10/21/23, 10:05:38 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: I'm glad they didn't define variables in Japanese 🌚 just the comments
[10/21/23, 10:06:04 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: This would be helpful!  In English!!!
https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/animations/animations.html
[10/21/23, 10:06:45 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: This yields the same output as the one I currently use (saving as .png and showing one by one), it's not a "smooth" movement
[10/21/23, 10:07:21 AM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: If you want smooth you need to make many graphs and change them slowly.
[10/21/23, 10:07:38 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Actually I do need to make an animation
[10/21/23, 10:08:21 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Generated like 80,000 rows of data and need to plot it as a smooth GIF 💀 still can't figure out how
[10/21/23, 10:08:35 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: If you can find a decent way it'd be helpful
[10/21/23, 10:09:27 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Actually I could share the data with y'all to mess around with 🧐 maybe someone could make a pretty plot that I can ~steal~ borrow
[10/21/23, 10:09:47 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Plus will be practice with actual data, so win-win
[10/21/23, 10:16:48 AM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: I tried it with some graphs in my project just to try it. It indeed was cool to see the values when you scroll over it, but the color combination were not as impressive as Seaborn so ended up using seaborn

[10/21/23, 10:26:09 AM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: Unlabeled?
[10/21/23, 10:26:19 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Yepp
[10/21/23, 10:26:35 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: It's just plotting, no ML, so no need for labels
[10/21/23, 10:27:15 AM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: Can also do some unsupervised analysis on it
[10/21/23, 10:27:30 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Wouldn't be useful ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 10:27:47 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: This is not "each data point representing an occurrence"
[10/21/23, 10:28:05 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: It's values of a function, imagine sin(θ)
[10/21/23, 10:28:11 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: We can't do ML on that
[10/21/23, 10:28:27 AM] ‪+1 (734) 635‑8370‬: Ok got it. Makes sense.
[10/21/23, 10:29:40 AM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: What I tried is:
re(z), im(z) = x, y
re(psi), im(psi) = z, colour
α = time
But feel free to be creative 🌚
[10/21/23, 10:34:10 AM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: I am planning to watch lecture 1 recording and if anyone interested join. I will share the google meet link shortly. I will start at 7:45 am pst ( in 10 mins from now)

[10/21/23, 11:10:09 AM] ‪+974 7730 3977‬: It seems this is a scatter plot with additional time series dimension… we should came across such plots after completing this week material
[10/21/23, 11:13:55 AM] ‪+1 (704) 962‑4113‬: If anyone needs refresher LINEAR REGRESSION, plus understanding R2 and errors. I found this short YouTube Playlist, its very short & easy to understand.
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF596A4043DBEAE9C&si=xrpqv_8L1vKjDXSR
[10/21/23, 11:18:40 AM] ‪+1 (703) 667‑0734‬: will Check it out
[10/21/23, 11:18:53 AM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: Those who could not watch all videos and not balance with work, family and personal time don’t worry. Post this class I am planning to watch every weekend allocate some time to watch all videos starting January and we can form some groups to do kaggle competition as a team . I want to be a continuous learner until I figure this course out myself . If anyone wants to join the journey we can for a group post this mit class and do it. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/21/23, 11:27:26 AM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: If you worked in a company for a long time you can predict what will be your company bonus based on your own data to predict what will be next quarter or year bonus . 😀. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 11:28:48 AM] ‪+1 (201) 315‑3086‬: Totally onboard on this .
[10/21/23, 11:30:35 AM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: X—-> attributes
Y—> labels
[10/21/23, 11:30:54 AM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: Y is single dimensional
X is multi dimensional
[10/21/23, 11:31:21 AM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: When y becomes multi dimensional it becomes different regression problem
[10/21/23, 11:34:17 AM] ‪+1 (781) 296‑2531‬: I find it odd that we are paying MIT to teach us but depending on YouTube for better understanding. Is MIT/ Great learning not doing a good job. Most of my learning is coming from YouTube videos
[10/21/23, 11:35:42 AM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: It streamline your way of thinking and what to find next. We should not focus on the math as this already done 100s years ago we should think the methodology
[10/21/23, 11:37:10 AM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: Now we understand better the terms of the ML, e.g., regression when the variable is continuous (the label). But when the variable is (the label) is identified finite number(integer or a whole) then it is classification
[10/21/23, 11:38:06 AM] ‪+1 (425) 269‑6988‬: Now thinking that way and understanding the models, this will make you a powerful decision maker in your organization or even better it will make you arrange your thoughts to build your own next big thing
[10/21/23, 11:46:17 AM] ‪+1 (437) 973‑9491‬: Anyone taken up the quiz yet?
[10/21/23, 11:47:39 AM] ‪+65 8303 1879‬: I did,  it’s easy mostly theoretical all from previous class
[10/21/23, 11:48:36 AM] ‪+1 (437) 973‑9491‬: So you scored 30 ;)
[10/21/23, 11:48:44 AM] ‪+65 8303 1879‬: Yes
[10/21/23, 11:55:04 AM] ‪+1 (437) 973‑9491‬: Wonder how this course would be? ! ?

Education is a business. They will not be able to satisfy all requirements. Secondly we need to be on this full time if we want to learn. 
Thirdly there is a lot of good material there. 
Fourthly they are providing a structure
Fifthly I would have not formed a bonding with this awesome group if it was not for MIT with bunch of brilliant cohorts
Lastly this is providing me an opportunity to upskill myself after 3 decades and definitely there are lot of challenges but I enjoy the passion of learning. 

This is a kickstarter of my data science background and there are ton of Udemy courses, courses with deep learning . Ai , etc
[10/21/23, 12:39:39 PM] ‪+1 (437) 973‑9491‬: I agree, it will take time to speed up on all of this. 2 years PG course done in 3 months 😂
[10/21/23, 1:37:17 PM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: I had been thinking of doing something similar as well. After this class is completed, we can have our own regular meetings and each person can pick a topic and explain to others, and we can also work on building our profile in this area.
[10/21/23, 1:38:01 PM] ‪+1 (408) 687‑8705‬: I had same issue year long Wharton CTO course most difficult was data analytics portion, post course I am able to connect to a lot of decision making process especially finance org. Go back and think through decisions taken - why would Citrix not owning a booth at are: Re: Invent what parameters went into it? ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 1:38:31 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Isn't the uni education in a nutshell 🌚🌚
[10/21/23, 1:41:46 PM] ‪+507 6840‑0045‬: No social life from now on 😫...just study and try to understand the classes,  and work
[10/21/23, 1:44:55 PM] ‪+1 (704) 962‑4113‬: Embrace the Pain now.. enjoy Rewards later
[10/21/23, 1:53:26 PM] ‪+1 (703) 944‑1994‬: Yeah. My wife is already yelling at me asking why did this again:)
[10/21/23, 1:53:39 PM] ‪+1 (703) 944‑1994‬: Why I did this again:)
[10/21/23, 1:54:28 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: You have all the social life you need in this group 💯
[10/21/23, 1:57:46 PM] ‪+1 (214) 326‑7221‬: Going through my own notes during lectures giving me more questions
[10/21/23, 2:57:07 PM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: The optional videos in Machine Learning is helping a lot in understanding lot of the concepts. Most of  the videos before splitting data can be skipped, those are repetition of EDA
[10/21/23, 2:57:36 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Did they use traintestsplit?
[10/21/23, 2:57:52 PM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: Yes
[10/21/23, 2:57:55 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Ah good
[10/21/23, 2:58:14 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Was wondering why previous week it wasn't mentioned
[10/21/23, 2:59:07 PM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: I am supplementing these videos with asking questions on ChatGPT,  to get little deeper understanding at every step. Finding that approach very useful to get the real context
[10/21/23, 2:59:40 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Can't wait for you to have a solid understanding and explain to the rest of us 🌚
[10/21/23, 3:02:28 PM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: Can someone from group 4 share me the zoom link
[10/21/23, 3:07:07 PM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: certainly, I will explain in person once we all meet at MIT campus. Just sponsor my trip to MIT :)
[10/21/23, 3:15:03 PM] ‪+1 (949) 413‑6369‬: And ours as well
[10/21/23, 3:16:31 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: I guess living with one kidney isn't that bad (⁠☞⁠ ͡⁠°⁠ ͜⁠ʖ⁠ ͡⁠°⁠)⁠☞
[10/21/23, 3:24:43 PM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: Less than 1 percent on phone calls ?
[10/21/23, 3:52:45 PM] ‪+1 (703) 888‑8535‬: Again? Wow! Hope it was not this same course :-)
[10/21/23, 4:10:47 PM] ‪+1 (305) 804‑3912‬: Let's do it!
[10/21/23, 4:11:41 PM] ‪+1 (630) 640‑3908‬: Count me in 👍🏻
[10/21/23, 4:14:09 PM] ‪+1 (305) 804‑3912‬: The best part of this program is that we get to meet each other. We all come from different walks of life and have different experiences and opportunities. This program may last 12 weeks, but being part of this community can pay off for years to come! Keep your head up and push it through.
[10/21/23, 4:20:39 PM] ‪+1 (857) 381‑8612‬: It is a bit annoying that the data file name is different from what is written in the jupyter notebook file...
[10/21/23, 4:24:37 PM] ‪+49 176 23224829‬: Yes, I think like the same. If we could meet in person afterwards, it would be even better 🤠👍🏻 ‎<This message was edited>

[10/21/23, 4:42:41 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: No, just some data I made some time ago, thought would share for y'all to test and mess around with since it's "real data" with many missing values and nan and so on, rather than clean perfect data
[10/21/23, 4:43:14 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Couldn't save it all in one .csv file because Excel's row number limit, so had to split to 19 files
[10/21/23, 4:43:58 PM] ‪+49 176 23224829‬: And what kind of data are they? Sales versus something?
[10/21/23, 4:44:27 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: No, function plot (3 inputs vs 2 outputs)
[10/21/23, 4:44:40 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: So basically 5d plot data

[10/21/23, 5:12:47 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Do df[df['feature']>value]
[10/21/23, 5:13:26 PM] ‪+971 52 375 7322‬: Now what you write is trying to find the 'restaurant_name' column from the number 50

[10/21/23, 5:19:28 PM] ‪+1 (510) 815‑2429‬: Thanks got it
[10/21/23, 5:22:33 PM] ‪+49 176 23224829‬: From my perspective it is really important to fully understand the math behind. You would not be able to make any meaningful decisions or interpretations without. As of right now almost the whole world is talking about AI. But the truth is, almost nobody understands what this is about. For that reason I signed up at MIT to really understand the math behind. That makes the difference and is at least from my perspective the key to a successful carrier…. 🤠👍🏻
[10/21/23, 5:32:21 PM] ‪+506 7209 1200‬: Absolutely. Knowing how the things work in background, behind the tools, behind the formulas is crucial .. 
I have tried Chat GTP just to relate concepts and understand the representation in the problems described. 
Additionally I have been checking videos where the linear and standard error, r^2 error formulas are explained to go deeper into details. 
Also I have watched videos that explained nothing about math but tools in Codelab or Jupyter, which is exactly your point, what is behind all of that? That's the differential. ‎<This message was edited>
