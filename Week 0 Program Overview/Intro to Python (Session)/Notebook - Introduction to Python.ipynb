Think of them as real-life dictionaries: you have a word (the \"key\") and a definition (the \"value\").\n","\n","In Python, dictionaries are a collection of key-value pairs. They're unordered, changeable, and do not allow duplicates - which means that each key must be unique. You can use any immutable data type as a key (like numbers or strings), and practically any data type as a value.\n","\n","Here's an example of a dictionary:\n","\n","```python\n","person = {\n","    \"name\": \"Alice\",\n","    \"age\": 25,\n","    \"city\": \"New York\"\n","}\n","```\n","\n","In this dictionary, \"name\", \"age\", and \"city\" are the keys, and \"Alice\", 25, and \"New York\" are the corresponding values.\n","\n","You can access the values in a dictionary by referring to the name of the key like this:\n","\n","```python\n","print(person[\"name\"])  # Will output: Alice\n","```\n","\n","If you want to change a value in the dictionary, you can do so by referencing the key:\n","\n","```python\n","person[\"age\"] = 26  # Alice just had a birthday!\n","```\n","\n","If you want to add a new key-value pair, you can do so like this:\n","\n","```python\n","person[\"job\"] = \"Engineer\"  # Alice is an Engineer\n","```\n","\n","You can also remove key-value pairs using the `del` keyword:\n","\n","```python\n","del person[\"city\"]  # Alice doesn't want to share her city anymore\n","```\n","\n","Dictionaries can also hold complex types like lists, tuples, and other dictionaries. This makes them really powerful for structuring and organizing data in your Python programs.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UALI9xgG6n3O"},"source":["<font color='blue'>*So the above data we have stored in a List or Tuple for each type of car is not linked directly with the type of car.
